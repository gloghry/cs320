"""
lore_GUI is a completely different GUI than what I worked on originally. It is very bare bones as time was a factor,
    but as a proof of concept, I think it works well! The button in the bottom left of the corner should scroll
    through entries, though only the first entry is shown right now.
    
    Text wrapping also proved to be an issue. Pygame has an 'easy' way to do this, but more work is needed to see
    how that text is split and sent. Jared also showed me to a python module that may do this as well, but as of now,
    the 'blurbs' is omitted until that can be figured out.
    
All Globals are repasted here. This is not to inflate lines, this is is just naturally how building a standalone GUI
    should probably go. There's no reason that the size of the window of main_GUI should the same size as this window
    inits need to happen every time pygame is started as this is an entirely new session of pygame pygame.init, 
    display.init, and font.init() are needed in every instance.
