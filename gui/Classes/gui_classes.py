SearchBox is the link to Jared cool cam (lore_searcher). He scrapes website(s) and creates an index of that information
    My GUI uses a search bar to send strings into his cool cam. We check to see if it exists and any information
    in the lore_GUI.py
    
Takes minimal arguments. No way to change text color or box color.
x position (top), y position (left), width, height, and text
    text is default built for one button, since this is more a one and done button.
    
SearchBox will adjust it's own width and height to fit the text given (default if none supplied)
    Static box sizes were an issue for me for a long time. x and y are only calculated in the top left accordingly.
    Ergo you will need to do the math ahead of time if you want x and y in a specfic spot.
    
SearchBox clears its own text after the first click, but maintaines it's size. The box does not grow to fit long entires,
    But I believe even long strings can be sent to lore_searcher even if they're out of bounds. 
    
I chose to make Search Blue to show that you could interact with it, and that it takes you to Jared's cool cam. It's not
    a button however, this is the rare exception.

TextBox was designed to be a one size fits all for boxes, but this quickly turned out to not work.
