~~~~~~~~~Explanations
This is a list of traits assigned by biome. Each hex will be given a biome, and will gain additional traits based on that.
Each trait has a description linked to it, which will be displayed to the user when they select a hex tile.
Each tile will have a total of 6 traits, each is marked by a percentage chance to get it (out of 100), and some of the traits are none.
Meaning, a tile may only have 2 traits. Once a trait is selected, it cannot be selected again.
