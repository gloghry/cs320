You take any challenge given to you
You have a habbit of staring
You don't pick up on sarcasm
You forget most names
You'll eat almost anything
You can't stand cowards
Your obsessed with making money
Your excommunicated by your family
You have a habbit of yelling
Your very soft spoken
Your alwasy cold
You're an insomniac
You hate your own race
You bite your own nails
You bite... other people nails?
You're scared of large crowds
You hate being the center of attention
