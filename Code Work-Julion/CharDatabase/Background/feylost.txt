You hold a fey mark, and were transformed in some way to be more animalistic or fairy like.
When you are asleep, a feywild spirit may visit you if the dm wishes it. You remember each visit, and can hold conversations of it.
Fey creatures are inclined to help you if you are in need while in the feywild.
