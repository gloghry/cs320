One night, though, the shaman of that tribe, Tecco, had a vision. This vision caused him to journey through the desert for a full year before he found a massive, artificially constructed cavern, in which he found a stone pillar. Before his very eyes, this pillar turned into a living statue of the god Zaltec, which gave him a prophecy commanding him and his tribe to go south. The image then faded back into a crude statue of the god, and Tecco carried the statue back to his tribe, repeating the exact prophecy all the way. The tribe then set out, heading south.\n\nYears later, when Tecco's grandson Cattl was shaman, they came to the Valley of Nexal, and claimed a small island in the center of the lakes on which to build their village. Here they built a pyramid to Zaltec as well, on which they placed the stone pillar that Tecco had carried back to them and they had carried with them for so long. They also pledged fealty to the greatest city-state in the Valley at the time, Tezat, and fought for it in the Valley's constant wars. In this time they grew strong and multiplied, until they made their move many years later.\n\nThe ancient Nexalans were fierce warriors, and Tezat came to rely on them in its fighting, for with their aid Tezat came close to conquering the entire Valley of Nexal. But the Nexalans allied with their rivals, Azatl and Zokik, and in a single campaign conquered their former ally, and then used threats and diplomacy to subdue the other city-states of the Nexal Valley. With these victories, their town grew into a city, and they took for themselves a new name, \"Nexala\".",

                        "However, Tenoch's son Ipana II succeeded where his predecessors failed, using subtlety and poison to accomplish where force had failed in his reign of twelve years. Ironically, the same poison he used to kill the leaders of Tezat was later used to kill him.",
                        "Upon Ipana II's death, his ten-year-old son Ipana III ascended to the throne, marking the start of one of Nexal's most prosperous periods. Ipana III ruled for fifty-one years, during which the other cities of the Valley were finally cemented under the rule of Nexal, and the first Feathered War was introduced to the Valley's inhabitants. But Ipana III's biggest contribution to Nexalan history was when he carried Nexal's dream of empire beyond the Valley, conquering the city-states of Cordotl and Palul and five of the six city-states of Huacli. Only the three-year-long siege of the sixth city-state, Otomi, and the campaign into Kultaka failed.",
                        "After Ipana III's death, of old age, his grand-nephew Tolco was crowned Revered Counselor. Tolco immediately went looking for a war. Since he had been part of the siege of Otomi, and knew the futility of attacking them, he instead launched disastrous campaign against Kultaka. After that failed, he spent nearly a decade fighting the Pezels, always defeating but never conquering them. His final campaign, again against Kultaka, ended when he himself was slain by an arrow.",
                        "With Tolco's death a great-grandson of Ipana III was chosen as Counselor. Tenoch II ruled for a peaceful twenty-one years, during which he had roads built connecting Nexal directly to Cordotl, Palul, and the Huacli border. The third road, which led into Pezelac was abandoned when the Pezels rebelled. The rebellion was quickly and brutally quashed by an army led by Tenoch II's son, Chimal.",

He ruled for eighteen years, during which the empire flourished and the roads were expanded, and with them trade. Nexalan merchants ventured as far as Payit under his reign, and the only fighting was limited to skirmishes with Kultaka.",

                        "It was one of Totep's military advisers and nephews, Zomoc, who ruled after him. Zomoc was responsible for the conquest of Kolan, which lasted a full twenty years during which Nexal's armies were commanded by the general Coyo, before his triumphal return to Nexal. But Zomoc, suspicious of Coyo, engineered his death. Aferwards Zomoc grew paranoid, and his death five years after Coyo's victory came as a relief to Nexal.",
                        "At Zomoc's death, the nephew of Coyo, a descendant of a cousin of the line of Ipana, was chosen as the Revered Counselor. Izco's short reign was marked by the expansion and consecration (with the sacrifice of 1,000 humans) of the great pyramid of Zaltec. However, the insufficiency of the consecration's sacrifice was made apparent when Mount Zatal erupted. Izco stepped down from his throne at the time, allowing his son to take over.",
                        "After a new consecration sacrifice, of 10,000 humans, was made on Zaltec's pyramid, Izco II was crowned. His reign was much like his father's, for their combined reigns of twenty-seven years were prosperous and peaceful.",
                        "However, the long period of peace left Nexal longing for war, and the military leader Pakli was crowned. He immediately launched simultaneous campaigns against Kultaka and Otomi, both of which ended in failure and worse- three of the five conquered Huacli cities rebelled against the army attacking Otomi, and rebellions also started in Kolan and Pezelac. Much of Pakli's fourteen-year reign was occupied with putting down these revolts.",
                        "Chalco was the Revered Counselor chosen after Pakli's death. He accomplished Nexal's greatest victories against Kultaka and Otomi, though he failed to conquer both. In Kultaka he nearly took the city, but was defeated by the young warrior Takamal, and Otomi he invaded and occupied for years, but eventually left since the natives had fled into the mountains, leaving their city empty. He sent missions into the northern desert searching for the cavern wherein Tecco found the stone pillar, and into the House of Tezca looking for Tewahcoa, the City of the Gods. Both searches ended in failure, though, Ultimately, Chalco's reign of twenty-six years was counted as one of the greatest in Nexal's history.",
                        "Chalco's grandson Axalt succeeded him at a young age. Axalt sent campaigns against Kultaka, in later years often led by his own son, Naltecona. However, his greatest accomplishment was the building of the great aqueduct that supplied Nexal's citizens with clear, fresh spring water. Axalt's death after twenty-two years marked the end of the rise of Nexal.",
                        "Naltecona ascended to the throne after his father's death. He ruled for a tragic twelve years, primarily marked by the decade of mysterious omens."

This talent, his eccentric personality, and veneration of the Joybringer goddess led to societal stigma among the kingdom's wizards. Despite being a pariah, Persephenon eventually worked his way to the position of a skyship captain. Thankful for the opportunity, Persephenon created the first robe of scintillating colors as a tribute to his deity to paint rainbows as he traversed the skies.\n\nThis display of flamboyancy eventually cost Persephenon respect and resulted in his exile from Halruaa. However, the scintillating sorcerer was welcomed by open-minded halfling of Luiren, where he found a new home and started creating copies of the colorful robes that once cost him so much.",

                "paras": "Founded in 999 DR, the village was originally a noble's villa, but strangely, the location of the village only appeared on maps of Cormyr dated from before 1160 DR.\n\nIn the mid-12th century DR,[note 1] King Proster Obarskyr ordered Volkumburgh's College of Shaping Magics to construct a new breed of stone golems, designed to help expedite his building projects. In later centuries, this information could only be found in a single obscure government document in Suzail.\n\nLater that same year Volkumburgh Vale was sacked by that same golem, leading to the destruction of both the magic colleges within it. Before his own villa was destroyed, Lord Volkumburgh hid his treasure in a secret cavern underneath it. A narrow passageway connected the treasure's concealed cavern to a trapdoor beneath the village's fountain. Lord Volkumburgh's treasure was known to the inhabitants of his village, though its location was not. Over time it would come to be known as \"Volki's treasure.\"\n\nLord Volkumburgh's manor would be rebuilt as the Crimson Wyrm, while the rest of its remains were used to construct the small village. Later, some man would approach the lord and task him with hiding one of the golem's hands within the village, which he tucked away beneath its fountain.\n\nOver the two centuries that followed their destruction, the residents of Volkumburgh would loot the ruins of the valley's colleges for valuables to either keep or sell. Many even considered it a right of passage to loot something sellable from the ruins.\n\nDuring the Flight of the Dragons, an adult red dragon by the name of Flashfire emigrated from the north, eventually coming to settle within the abandoned Temple of the Dragon Oracle in 1358 DR.[note 3] He went on to force knowledge of the temple's location upon the inhabitants of Volkumburgh, demanding they bring him a monthly tribute in the form of five sheep. Though, even when this tribute was paid, Flashfire's gargoyle minions would still sometimes terrorize Volkumburgh Vale, stealing sheep from shepherds such as Clemon.\n\nIn 1358 DR,[note 2] the wizard Amelior Amanitas set up a workshop in the village in the form of a huge tower, after a man named Lychor introduced him to to the fragmented legends of this golem, as well as some fragments of it that he managed to merge back together into an arm through use of potions. Amelior's efforts to reconstruct the golem attracted the attention of the devout followers of Valmous and their neanderthal allies, who occupied the college ruins and kept the villagers from getting into them.\n\nAs a result of this, over time the Awtawmatawn, the ruins of the magical colleges, Amelior Amanitas, and the arm he found all became taboo topics in the village. Amelior later discovered one of the statue's feet in a temple in Suzail, which locals mistakenly believed to be a piece of Grumbar. In the month of Uktar, some time before the Feast of the Moon, he arranged for the foot to be shrunken down, stolen, and then delivered to him by a group of adventurers in Suzail. Estimating where the other fragments might be, he then tasked them with seeking out the rest of the fragments.\n\nThose adventurers went on to recover one of the golem's lost hands, hidden beneath a fountain in the village. The discovery of this hand led many villagers to conclude that Volki's treasure had to be hidden somewhere in the village. Thus they proceeded to dig many pits and trenches within the village green.\n\nA few days after the collected parts were turned in to Amelior, the awakened Valmous and his disciples attacked the village alongside an army of neanderthals, seeking to destroy the Awtawmatawn. At the same time, Lychor unleashed a counter-force of undead in hopes of both protecting the golem and claiming it for himself. This horde of undead included a hundred skeletons, twenty zombies, and ten wights. During this siege Awtawmatawn finally awakened and began to rampage around Volkumburg, destroying Amelior's workshop in the process. Both armies, as well as everyone else in the village, stopped to gawk as this occurred. Lychor then used the distraction to cast a deadly spell on Valmous and those around him, putting him out of action for the rest of the battle.\n\nAmelior would gift the adventurers a number of magic items to aid them in the battle. These included brass bottles containing his two loyal ogre servants and the djinn Hasan, a brass bottle that unleashed a ballista with twenty bolts that was manned by four zombies, three potions of growth, three potions of giant strength, and a potion labeled \"Drink Me If All Else Fails\" that would transform the imbiber into a red dragon. Ultimately, the adventurers prevailed and the golem was destroyed after it fell upon the Crimson Wyrm and down through the cavern that was hidden beneath it.\n\nAs of 1369 DR, the Crimson Wyrm had been repaired and Volkumburgh was still a rustic village of miners and sheep farmers.",

                "paras": "Randal Morn had been fighting for Daggerdale's liberty since 1339 DR, when he was a young man of about sixteen winters. Gathering a small band of outcasts, he formed the Freedom Riders, a rebel force whose single goal was to overthrow the Zhentarim-sponsored government that had ruled Daggerdale since 1316 DR.\n\nTheir numbers increased to a hundred in the early 1350 DRs. About half of them were cavalrymen who fought on horseback; the rest were mounted infantrymen who could quickly dismount and fight on foot. Being mounted provided them with the mobility to strike at Zhent-controlled hamlets hard and fast. As a guerrilla-style unit, the Freedom Riders never established a permanent headquarters, but they often used Castle Daggerdale and the surrounding hills as a base of operations.\n\nTheir numbers increased steadily over the next few years as Randal and his officers, Lord Ariton Delmis and the ranger Mestin Durmark, went from hamlet to hamlet seeking support from the masses. Peasants and noblemen alike fought under his flag. Since most of these people did not own horses, however, and could not be provided one by the Riders, the creation of an infantry unit became essential. Some of the mounted infantry became regular footmen, but most of them trained to become true cavalrymen. Perhaps the most important development during this expansion period, however, was the addition of the mounted crossbowmen. They provided the Riders with a fast and powerful unit capable of both hit-and-run maneuvers and open battlefield missile support.\n\nBy the mid-1360 DRs, the Riders' strength had almost doubled, and included fifty or so mercenaries and volunteer troops from Mistledale and Shadowdale. About half the Riders' total were infantrymen. Unlike the cavalry, though, which somewhat depended on great numbers, the infantry had become too large to manage, and so were divided between Mestin and her former lieutenant, Reiner Trall.\n\nBy the time of Randal's disappearance prior to the battle for Dagger Falls in 1369 DR, the Riders had peaked at a maximum strength of about 210 soldiers and mercenaries. During the days leading up to the battle, however, their numbers swelled to more than 500, possibly even 600, as volunteers poured in from every corner of the dale and beyond.\n\nThe organizational structure of the Freedom Riders remained virtually unchanged since Daggerdale achieved its independence.",

The story knew him as a young wizard, riding a horse when he heard the cries of a young woman\u2014the goddess Sel\u00fbne, tricked and menaced by the monstrous extraplanar conqueror Imgig Zu. Bravely, he raced to her rescue, hurling a spell at Imgig. Although he was not powerful enough to defeat the monsters, he was able to cause enough confusion and chaos that Sel\u00fbne could escape, climbing onto his horse. To defeat the creatures, the goddess drained her life force away and imprisoned the monsters inside a pocket dimension within a gigantic moonstone, which should contain them for all time. She reduced the gem, now known as Sel\u00fbne's Eye, in size and gave it to Ostus for safe keeping. He never knew that Sel\u00fbne had sacrificed her youth to do so.\n\nThe story diverged at this point. In some versions, Sel\u00fbne went back to her home, and brought the young mage with her. Others told that the young mage loved her, but she rejected his advances because she was no longer young or beautiful.\n\nLater, whilst still a young mage, Ostus was apparently foraging for components for cures and potions near Shadowdale when he'd met and been seduced by a \"wicked\" woman, in fact, a drow sorceress of the region. A child was born of this tryst, Cybriana. Shortly after her birth, her mother took her to an elf village in Shadowdale and abandoned her, leaving her in the care of an elderly elven woman. Cybriana's mother departed, teleporting away by some magic. This was all Cybriana knew of her heritage; she did not know her father's name for many years, and knew only that he wore a gem called Sel\u00fbne's Eye. Cybriana was a typical half-elf baby, marred only by a strange dark birthmark that developed into a horrid growth, one that bore an evil face. It was thought to be a manifestation of the mother's evil. As the growth threatened to kill her, the village council performed a shamanic rite to extract the dark spirit. Young Cybriana was cured and freed, but the dark spirit escaped. The dark spirit transformed into a drow woman who called herself Kilili. Meanwhile, the monstrous Imgig Zu, still trapped within Sel\u00fbne's Eye, observed all this and forged a magical link with Kilili, allowing him to escape into the Realms. However, he needed Cybriana and Kilili together to release the rest of his people. Kilili fell in with Imgig, and together they hatched their scheme.",

Ostus Agrivar became one of the most renowned and well-respected mages of the North, and was recognized for his great goodness.\n\nAt one point, Ostus worked with the mage Parwyyd Hanifar, exploring the frontiers of magic together. They built the Great Door on the outskirts of Waterdeep, in order to easily enter the planes. Each wizard needed the other to control the Door.\n\nBy the early 1350s DR, Ostus said he had retired from active magic use, bar occasionally speaking with elementals. He wished to prepare his son to succeed him as Lord Agrivar, though Priam was not done adventuring.\n\nHowever, Imgig Zu had finally caught up with Ostus. In the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR, riding a wyvern, Imgig broke through the wall and magical defenses of Ostus's Hold and attacked father and son. Priam was crippled by Zu's staff of withering and Ostus slain by his death spell. The attacker seized the Sel\u00fbne's Eye and left.

This was how Cybriana found him, somehow knowing she had to seek out the paladin Agrivar, though not knowing him to be her brother. As she related her tale, a recovering Priam realized they shared a father.\n\nFinally, as Imgig Zu's plot came together, brother and sister confronted him. Imgig taunted Priam and threatened to kill him as he had killed Ostus Agrivar. But, ultimately, Priam struck and slew Imgig Zu in the name of their father. Cybriana and Kilili touched and merged into one being, the living key to Sel\u00fbne's Eye. The merged being vanished inside the gem, drawing all of Imgig's people back within, saving the Realms from devastation at the cost of her unique identity. A merged being levitated down, passing the shrunken Sel\u00fbne's Eye to Priam. Part Cybriana and part Kilili, she combined their names and named herself \"Kyriani Agrivar\", a new daughter of Ostus Agrivar.\n\nLater that year, the Great Door had somehow opened on its own, and Parwyyd sought one with \"the blood of Agrivar\", who also bore his magic aura, to help him close it. He used a false image of Priam to lure Kyriani to the Door, and enlisted her aid, but felt that the merger of Cybriana and Kilili had been incomplete. In the ensuring battle, Kyriani was separated into the two women again. However, it was Kilili who retained Ostus's aura. Parwyyd surmised that Kilili, the evil spirit she had been, and the strange growth on Cybriana she had emerged from, was the product of the evil of both her parents. Even a man as goodhearted as Ostus had had a dark side, one that all humankind possessed. Ultimately, Cybriana accepted her own dark side and re-merged with Kilili, producing a new and more whole Kyriani, one who could make her own destiny.",

After the death of Rythan in the Battle of Nightflames in 1334 DR, Alemander married Rythan's grieving fianc\u00e9e, Lady Rhinda, in that same year.\n\nRhinda did not love Alemander, but he provided for her well, and he allowed her to travel often outside of Tethyr. She became pregnant two months after their marriage, but the pregnancy was kept a secret, perhaps because of Alemander V. Rhinda and Alemander IV's son Haedrak was born the next year far away in Silverymoon, unknown to all but a select few. Alemander IV gave his wife full charge over raising their son, provided she ensured that he also had an education in magic for his own protection.\n\nThe king died on Eleint 12 in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR, when Castle Tethyr was burned to the ground by an act of arson. This began the period of rioting and terror known as the Ten Black Days of Eleint and ushered in the Tethyrian Interregnum.

It never saw snow, however.\n\nWhether in the depths of winter or the height of summer, and even in bright sun, the marsh and forest were forever shrouded with a persistent mist or murky vapor. Thin and sticky, it hugged the branches of the trees, pooled in depressions and hollows, and flowed over land and around obstacles, moving almost like a living thing. The ever-present and obscuring mist made it hard to see more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) in any direction, even if one could see over or past the trees. Even fog from the Dragonmere coast constantly rolled inland towards the swamp. Fogs there grew thick and impenetrable.",

Nevertheless, lizardmen dwelling in the Vast Swamp sometimes ventured down the Darkflow to raid villages. The village of Battlerise, which stood on the west bank of the Darkflow River, was once beset by lizardmen from the river and monsters emerging from the Vast Swamp. Long before the 1360s DR, its population had plummeted. The lizardmen also raided the monastic settlement of Monksblade further up the Way of the Manticore, contributing to its depopulation over centuries. By the 1360s DR, Ghars also lay within reach of Vast Swamp raiders, but was well defended. The town of Thunderstone was also well protected against the dangers of the swamp.\n\nNevertheless, the Vast Swamp enticed explorers who would brave the dangers and endure the difficult environment. Many famed explorers and adventurers, even whole bands, went into the Vast Swamp, and few were heard of again. However, at a national level, neither Cormyr nor Sembia themselves had attempted any major expeditions into the Vast Swamp before the late 14th century DR. Hence few people knew for sure what lurked in the darkest, dankest depths of the swamp.",

They caught and trapped them there against the swamp's western shore and finally defeated them.\n\nIn the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR, the Lost King Gondegal, who attempted to carve his own kingdom out of Cormyr, extended his reach as far east as the Vast Swamp.\n\nIn the late 1340s DR, the Thunderstone farmer Del Geery (whose farmland extended to the edge of the Vast Swamp) sponsored the explorer Hadley Erridge for a thirty-man expedition into the Vast Swamp to capture a live hydra. Two months later, they returned with an adult hydra in a cage of iron. Ultimately, Geery developed a variety of uses for hydra body parts and began to fund new hydra-hunting expeditions into the Vast Swamp. He was very successful at this new trade by 1367 DR.\n\nAround 1357 DR, an adventuring group called the Moon's Twelve went into the Vast Swamp. The last surviving member, Sylara, returned to civilized lands ranting and delirious about discovering an elven ruin as old and as extensive as Myth Drannor but her group was ambushed and pursued by mind flayers and beholders. She died of a swamp fever before she could elaborate further and no one knew if what she saw actually existed.\n\nBrother Twick, a knowledgeable halfling cleric of Chauntea who studied the marshes of Cormyr on behalf of the Naturalists' Guild, made a few expeditions into the Vast Swamp before 1367 DR. His aim was to further knowledge of botany and wildlife and to seek converts for the Grain Goddess. He found no potential believers, but plenty of experiences of horror. Nevertheless, he survived to become an authority on the place and its dangers.\n\nIn the late 1360s DR, the Dragonslayer lizardfolk tribe (so named for claiming to have killed several dragons over the decades) slew the black dragon Tyra and moved into her lair. However, Tyra's brother Despayr came and massacred many of the Dragonslayers, and enslaved the survivors. He then took her lair and hoard as his own. He had a daughter by one of the lizardfolk, Ketsarra Shadowscale, who became their new chieftain. In time, Despayr was visited by Esvele Graycastle, who retrieved from the treasure the shadow shard, with which Despayr transformed the lizardfolk slaves and even his daughter into the first of the undead Shadowscales. The Dragonslayers were no more.[note 1]\n\nIn the service of Esvele's scheme, Despayr sought to dominate much of the Vast Swamp. Their goal was to tear a hole in the Weave of magic and so form a dead-magic zone over all the Vast Swamp. It was to be a powerbase for the followers of Shar and an earthly homeland for their shadar-kai allies. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, at Despayr's behest, the Shadowscales made savage war upon the tribes of the Vast Swamp, particularly the other lizardfolk, who could hardly resist the shadowslain raiders. Many were slain and more were captured and carried off to the Lost Refuge, eventually returning as Shadowscales themselves to attack their own kin. However, the lowly Kessessek proved himself by turning the Shadowscales and the leaderless Sharptooths acclaimed him as their new chieftain. Kessessek adopted an aggressive but canny strategy against the mightier Shadowscales. He made an alliance between the Sharptooths and the Blackscales and Poison Dusks\u2014other tribes attacked by the Shadowscales\u2014and so they survived against further raids. Then, in early Eleint, he led a war party of Sharptooths, Blackscales, and Poison Dusks into Shadowscale territory around the Skull Staff. They hoped to slay some Shadowscales or their Shar-worshiping allies, or else capture some of the \"dream walkers\"\u2014mind-controlled petitioners of a false Temple of Mystra\u2014that regularly passed that way to the Lost Refuge. Kessessek and his kin recognized that these dream walkers were innocents and hoped to capture them, free their minds, and deny this resource to their shared enemy.\n\nIn fact, the next group to pass that way were adventurers in service to Mystra investigating the false temple and Sharrans' activities. Parlaying at the Sharptooth encampment, Kessessek aided and enlisted the adventurers to deal with the Shadowscales at the Lost Refuge. Afterward, as the adventurers went into the Plane of Shadow to end the Shadowscale and Sharran threats, the Sharptooths took over and guarded the Lost Refuge. When they returned, the Sharptooths feted them as heroes. In the following weeks, after War Wizards investigated the Lost Refuge, the kingdom of Cormyr made an alliance with the Sharptooth tribe. Limited trade even began between lizardfolk and human, and the Vast Swamp lost a little of its mystery and dread to the Cormyreans, though they still declined to go near it.",

Surprisingly, these hydrae were profitably hunted by Del Geery of Thunderstone in the 1360s.\n\nOf the black dragons, at least two young drakes laired in the Vast Swamp in the mid-to-late 1300s. These were Tyra and Despayr, and were the spawn of the great Skurge of the Marshes of Tun. Although Tyra was slain in the late 1360s, Despayr became notorious for allying with the cult of Shar and attempting to conquer the whole Vast Swamp in 1374 DR.\n\nWill-o'-wisps were also found there, and were often sighted from the Way of the Manticore.\n\nMeazels were widespread in the Vast Swamp. They lived out of crude shelters in the deep swamp and regularly preyed upon kobolds and goblins and even orcs that they could catch alone. Although not populous enough to serious affect local ecology or society, the goblins, and kobolds, and orcs saw the meazels as magical spirits who kidnapped humanoids to devour. In efforts to ward them off, lone orcs and goblins carried charms and fetishes, while kobolds tried to appease them by leaving their own kind, bound but alive, as sacrifices. The meazels took these offerings, and still hunted the kobolds.\n\nDarktentacles were among the rarest yet deadliest predators of the Vast Swamp. They lurked beneath the water's surface and surprised and seized victims with their tentacles. When one became known to swamp denizens, they carefully avoided it. A darktentacles could eradicate all fish and birdlife in an area in weeks before it moved to fresh hunting grounds.

Rather than follow the traditional lizardfolk god Semuanya, they paid homage to evil spirits of nature and to fiends, especially the demon lord Sess'innek. Shamans of these lizardfolk fashioned strange altars and icons from the bones of animals and sacrificial victims, and there conducted brutal rites. He reported these lizardfolk gathered into tribal groups of only around a dozen members and that they were nomadic, erecting no permanent structures or shelters.

These lizardfolk followed Semuanya, even Essylliss. Only the undead Shadowscales, the former Dragonslayer tribe twisted to suit a dragon's ends, were hostile.

If it was widely imagined that evil lurked and festered in such places, then it was entirely likely it did in the Vast Swamp, and even authorities like Brother Twick were inclined to believe it and fear it would spread. There was, as yet, no tangible proof of this, but neither was there a better explanation. Nevertheless, all those who lived outside the Vast Swamp, namely the folk of Cormyr, shunned the place and shared all kinds of horror stories about what went on there.\n\nIt was commonly claimed that at one time dark magic was practiced here or that forbidden gods were worshiped, and this was the cause of the evil, but this was unverified. Nevertheless, evil magic was rumored to lay about the swamp. According to one legend, early inhabitants of the area once gave refuge to a vile demigod and were cursed for their deeds. Some speculated this was in fact a stunningly powerful beholder or the Imperator of the grell. More recent versions of this legend (post\u2013Time of Troubles) told that it was the god Cyric who sheltered in the Vast Swamp, and his evil lingered.\n\nAccording to one legend, the notorious Dusk Lord of Sessrendale was not killed as history recorded, but instead escaped into the Vast Swamp. There, the story said, he plotted vengeance against all living beings in the Dalelands. The Dusk Lord was the most well known of the villains said to inhabit this land.\n\nThere were rumors of both mind flayer and beholders lurking in an ancient ruin close to the center of the marsh.This could well be the elven ruins reported by Sylara of the Moon's Twelve, who were ambushed and slaughtered by such abominations.\n\nThere was something to support the idea of an ancient elven kingdom once lying in this land, as several items of old elven design had been retrieved over the years. Furthermore, other treasures including elaborately ornamented crowns, amazing gemstones, scintillating armor pieces, and weaponry of exotic design and make had also been found, apparently created by different hands in different cultures and in different times. Perhaps these had originated elsewhere and been carried into the Vast Swamp by adventurers or raiders, but they hinted a number of lost and forgotten kingdoms that predated the Vast Swamp and were later buried in its bogs. Only a close archaeological examination could say for sure.\n\nNecromancers were reputed to make their homes in the Vast Swamp. Some stories even told that, somewhere deep inside the swamp, there was a ruined necropolis or some other complex of ruined structures. Herein dwelled a lich or even a whole cabal of liches, in tattered black clothing and wielding archaic and exotic weaponry, alongside countless skeletons and zombies. From these liches, it was said, flowed an unremitting evil force that contaminated all that stayed overlong in the area.\n\nIndeed, Cormyrean investigators theorized that not only was the Vast Swamp slowly growing, but it had a malevolent influence on those outside. Incidences of violent crime, such as arson, brawling, feuding, and murder were apparently increasing in neighboring settlements in the 1360s DR. However, it was hard to say whether this was due to the evil of the swamp or merely to the troubles of that era.\n\nWorse still, several humanoid tribes and inhuman monsters foretold of an impending unification and subsequent holy war against the humans of Cormyr and surrounding realms. For example, the hobgoblins believed they would unite and conquer the human realms in the name of Cyric the Black Sun, while the grell believed they would do so under the god-like Imperator. True or not, it seemed inevitable that an ambitious warlord or mage or other dominant entity would try to fulfill these prophecies to gather an army. In fact, something much like this occurred when Despayr attempted to conquer and control the Vast Swamp for the goddess Shar using the marauding Shadowscale lizardfolk in 1374 DR.[note 3]",

Aris survived and taken captive with charm-magic for a time by the eye tyrant Kanabar. The lone giant was freed from his magical bondage when a band of travelers, comprising Galaeron Nihmedu, Melegaunt Tanthul, Vala Thorsdotter and Malik el Sami, killed the beholder and its allies.\n\nAs his community's only survivor, Aris accompanied his rescuers as they traveled towards the Delimbiyr Vale through the High Forest, granted special disposition by Turlang himself, passing through the Dire Wood until their final destination at the ancient city of Karse. Once there, Aris bravely dug a deep tunnel that drew the phaerimm away from his new friends long enough for them complete a ritual to bring back Melegaunt's home city from the plane of Shadow. Aris was tortured by the aberrant creatures and just barely managed to survive the ordeal.\n\nAris survived the ordeal and soon relocated to the city of Thultanthar with Malik, Galaeron, and Vala. He found immediate success within the city, impressing even the Princes of Shade and the mighty archmage, High Prince Telamont Tanthul himself. Tensions grew between the group as the Harper witch Ruha openly stated her intent to arrest Malik, and Galaeron grew resentful of Vala and their Shadovar hosts. When Galaeron told the others he would leave Thultanthar and venture across the Anauroch desert alone, Malik convinced Aris follow him, while simultaneously staging the giant's death and framing Ruha for his murder. While traveling across the Saiyaddar Aris suffered greatly from dehydration, a condition that was made worse by the selfish actions of his friend Galaeron. The giant was nearly killed during an attack from a blue dragon, but survived by the efforts of the witch Ruha. Aris' near-death experience shook Galaeron, pulling him back from the malign influence of his shadow self.\n\nOnce Aris was in better condition, he traveled with Galaeron and Ruha to Arabel in Cormyr. His arrival was welcomed and even celebrated by Myrmeen Lhal, who was a great fan of his artistry. Despite this, the trio were accused of theft by Prince Rivalen Tanthul of Thultanthar, and imprisoned within the Citadel. While in the dungeons of the Citadel, Rivalen and his Shadovar attempted to free the group from their cells\u2014to take them back to Thultanthar\u2014but were intercepted by Myrmeen Lhal, Regent Alusair Obarskyr and her royal retinue. She executed several of the Shadovar on the spot, and ensured Aris and his friends were safe.\n\nAris returned the favor to the Lady Regent and Cormyr by assisting the Mage Royal Vangerdahast by transporting a powerful magical contraption into and through the city of Tilverton while it was under siege by the Shadovar. Aris was taken to safety before the city fell, and\u2014having made amends with his friend Galaeron\u2014offered the elf a friendly and fond farewell before the city was ultimately destroyed.",

If the target managed to partially dodge the flying silk, it was only slowed to half speed for a minute. Otherwise, the target was completely entangled for that minute unless they were strong enough to break the strand, clever and flexible enough to escape from the tangle, or someone else cut them free. The silk was highly flammable, but burning it was likely to burn the entangled creature as well. It was very difficult to cast a spell while entangled, requiring great concentration.\n\nA spider wand had five to fifty charges upon creation. Every use of one of the two powers of the wand caused it to be drained of one charge. If it was drained completely, the wand turned into a long-dead husk of a spider and then to dust, but a powerful cleric could recharge the wand. The silk coming from the wand acted as a rope of entanglement, meaning it could shoot 10\u202ffeet  (3\u202fmeters) upwards or 20\u202ffeet  (6.1\u202fmeters) horizontally and automatically entangle a number of creatures depending on their size. For example, one shot from this wand could ensnare 24 flumphs, 12 pixies, 8 humans, 2 manticores, or 1 tyrannosaurus. The strand was unbreakable: it had to be cut by someone not entangled, or burned to remove it. Otherwise, it evaporated after three minutes and released its captives.\n\nThe second power these items had was to deliver a deadly poison via striking a person with one in melee combat. The rod's poison caused a severe weakening of the victim's constitution, possibly enough to be fatal if the victim could not resist its potency. This ability could be used with no limit at any time the rod was not projecting a silk strand. The wand's venom was fatal in two minutes or less, unless the victim could fight it.

In 1358 DR, he traveled to Marsember in Cormyr, where he visited an engineering college and recruited a graduate named Ivar Devorast to come back with him to Innarlith to help him construct the ship. Devorast did much of the planning and design of the ship, with Fharaud's approval. However, Devorast distrusted the use of magic portals to transport the ship between the Lake of Steam and the Vilhon Reach.\n\nThe ship was completed and launched in 1360 DR with Fharaud and a skeleton crew piloting the ship. It went through a magic portal, but rather than going to its intended location in the Vilhon Reach, the portal cut the ship in pieces and dropped it, along with the crew, from a great height over the place where it was supposed to go. The crew were killed and Fharaud was severely injured and left bedridden for the rest of his life.\n\nDevorast would later be the man who came up with the plan to dig a canal from the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow, and thus connect the Sea of Fallen Stars to the oceans of Toril. However, his history with the Everwind was used as grounds to question his engineering ability.",

He eventually became, however, a man of wealth and power, and a follower of the god Bhaal. He took residence in a fortress hidden in the mountain of Sentinelspire, where, armed with divine inspiration, he created a garden where every pleasure was at hand for his followers, assassins he sent across the land and put in the service of the rich and powerful. He often sought as payment official sanction for the worship of Bhaal. \nDuring this time, Alaodin gathered a number of killers to himself, including an orphan from Elversult, Kheil, and a tribal half-orc, Sauk. After the death of Bhaal, he began looking feverishly for other sources of power, including relics, lore, and allies. All in all, there were about fifty followers of the Old Man by 1367\u00a0DR, including some wizards.\n\nAround 1363\u00a0DR, Chereth reached out to Alaodin through contacts in Glarondar, requesting an audience to study the Imaskari fortress of Sentinelspire. The Old Man of the Mountain granted him the request, presumably hoping that the druid would uncover something he could use, and he spent days and nights studying the relics in the fortress, until he came across Erael'len, which he stole, slaying several assassins while escaping. In retaliation, Alaodin sent his best assassins, including Kheil and Sauk, after Chereth and his allies in the Yuirwood on 1365\u00a0DR. The attempt on Chereth's life was unsuccessful.\n\nBy 1369\u00a0DR, Alaodin had put down two insurrections, as the death of his god in 1358\u00a0DR and Chereth's escape in 1363\u00a0DR had far reduced his standing. The second insurrection, led by his daughter Talieth, had led to the death of almost half of the Blades of the Old Man, and left the others far from fighting shape. That year, Chereth returned and slew Alaodin, impersonating him thereafter.",

Unsurprisingly, the weather conditions (urged on by clerics of Auril) did not allow for a smooth flight. The balloon supporting the airship popped, and it fell to the ground.\n\nAfter an adventuring party rescued the Kuldahar druid, named Nathaniel, from the temple of Auril, Oswald and Nathaniel left on his airship.

That wand was activated by the command word \"Plessendar. During the same period of time, another wand was listed in the book High Magic of Mirabar as being part of the city's treasury. That wand was activated with the command word \"Skulpin.\" The wand from Mirabar later went missing. Another wand was evidently owned by Azoun Obarskyr II or a cabinet member. Elminster Aumar theorized that a parchment with the command word \"Ailun\" was the evidence of that. The Azoun Obarskyr the Second's was gone and missing in the 14th century DR as well.\n\nIn 1281 DR, one of the wand of armory was stashed away many years prior inside the Black Wolf Temple in the Vale of Shadows of the Spine of the World.

In the 1340s DR, her followers erected the fortress of Frostspire out of glacial ice northeast of Citadel Adbar, and once it was completed, the High Icemaiden demanded that all of Auril's clergy make a pilgrimage to Frostspire to swear fealty to her.\n\nOver the next decade, it became her goal to put all of Auril's followers \"in their places\" within her church hierarchy. Unsurprisingly, this made her many enemies among her fellow Aurilians, and one of whom successfully killed her in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR. Tellingly, the assassin received no rebuke from Auril, and Aronthan's undead spirit remained trapped and tormented in Frostspire by the goddess herself.",

When Treshla was utterly destroyed by a colony of beholders that descended upon the city in 1101 DR, the Balance remained for more than a century, floating unnoticed over the ruins, until it was spotted by a Calishite satrap passing by on a carpet of flying. The satrap, Ylearyn Glaermauz, transported the Balance back to his estate in eastern Calimshan, where it remained until the estate was in turn destroyed by trolls and the Balance was once again lost to history.\n\nThe Balance is known to have passed through the hands of the proprietor of the Masked Marilith, an antiquities shop in Saerloon, and been sold to the merchant rogue Luuthateel Dree, who wrongly believed that the Balance might help him achieve immortality. After being offered an ultimatum by a Tyrran priest to return the object, Dree fled, reportedly into the Underdark.\n\nSince then, the object resurfaced briefly in markets in Silverymoon and Berdusk, but the object continued to elude the Tyrrans, who went so far as to accuse the Harpers of obstructing their efforts to recover the object. The Harpers denied having withheld the object, with Lady Cylyria Dragonbreast of Berdusk even volunteering to submit to questioning under a discern lies spell to dispute the accusation.",

They enjoyed watching prisoners and monsters battle in arenas. Surrounded by stands of seating, battles took place inside huge crystal cylinders, 30 feet (9 m) wide and 50 feet (15 m) high and several feet thick, with small holes piercing the ceiling to permit air. The walls were translucent; a captive could barely see out, but spectators could see in easily enough. The wizards would even take krakentua buds, and force newly hatched krakentua spawn to fight. A krakentua related these events via dreams to adventurers in the Fochu Peninsula in Wa in 1358 DR.[note 3]\n\nAccording to Shou Lung legend, the Second Emperor Chin of the Ho Dynasty of Shou Lung (crowned \u2212620\u00a0DR) used a magic ring to enslave a family of enormous giants from the wilds of Koryo. He set them to work raising the massive stone blocks of the Fortress of Kuai. When he died, he had the giants place a huge stone block to seal his body inside the fortress, along with his treasure and enchanted ring.[note 4]",

Peacemen and peacewomen were most often half-elves, halflings, or sirines.\n\nThe five branches of the church had smooth relationships with open communication channels. Conflicts were unheard of, and even more militant clergy wings were respectful or aging clerics and pacifist wings.",

The opposition was seldom done in a violent manner as the clergy worked in subtle ways to stop harm to nature.\n\nEldathyns were also tasked by the church to monitor local wildlife, keep a record of animal species and their numbers, migration, and changes to both local flora and fauna. These reports were passed along to senior priests, who in turn, share them with the clergies of Silvanus and Mielikki, who monitored and maintained ecologies.\n\nWhen a need for money arose within the church, priests offered their services as herbalists, healers, gardeners, potion makers, and water dowsers through the water divination spell.

Some scholars connected the Ondonti concept of Tarek-Passar, or the Way of Peace, to the Church of Eldath, leading to a theory that \"the Founders\" were priests of the Quiet One.\n\nOne of the earliest appearances of the Church of Eldath in annals of history happened in the Year of Clinging Death, 75 DR, when a plague ravaged the Vilhon Reach. Eventually, the disease passed. Following that, Eldathyn druids made important improvements to the water supplies of the cities of the Vilhon.\n\nThe Opening of the Year of Soaring Stars, 261 DR, marked the beginning of the Golden Age of the elven city of Myth Drannor. As the city welcomed members of other races, churches of non-elven deities established a hold in the City of Song. The Church of Eldath arrived with its human clergy, who started venerating the quiet goddess around the forest city's pools, springs, waterfalls, and druid groves.\n\nIn the Year of the Dancing Deer, 351 DR, a huge contingent of refugees flocked to the ancient elven city of Yrlaancel. The city quickly swole in size and was renowned by the Eldathyn faithful to Ondathel, Eldath's City of Peace.\n\nIn the Year of the Bloodcrystals, 627 DR, Ecamane Truesilver of Myth Drannor, accompanied by his nine apprentices, arrived to the city of Silverymoon. The High Mage claimed to have been blessed and guided by Eldath, Mielikki, Lurue, Mystra, and Sehanine Moonbow, to create a college of mages in the Gem of the North.\n\nThe Year of the Dawn Rose, 720 DR saw a great gathering of clergy of Eldath, Deneir, Lliira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Sel\u00fbne, and some other deities that venerated all that is good. With guidance and leadership of Elminster Aumar, the churches agreed to work together against gods that spread death, destruction, and discord across Faer\u00fbn. This meeting of churches atop the Dancing Place was the birth of Those Who Harp.\n\nIn the Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR, the clergy of Eldath from the Temple of the Trembling Flower in Alagh\u00f4n managed to imprison Malarite mohrg Borran Klosk in stasis underneath one of the church's crypts. The creature was released from Eldath's trap of magical ice in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR by a group of children guided by Malar.\n\nCyric, the Prince of Lies, built his grotesque throne out of the bones of mortals who died mistakingly believing in their delusions in service of other gods. One such mortal was a druid of Eldath who drowned everyone who happened to come across a hidden pool of water. The druid believed that they unrest the peace and commuted ungodly crimes, only to end up dead and part of Cyric's throne of lies.\n\nIn the Hammer of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, a strange plague started spreading through Iriaebor, killing twenty unfortunate souls.

In this climate, the clan dwindled, and King Teirgoh had had enough. The king gathered his fellow dwarves and led them underground, in search of their ancestral home.\n\nUsing secret knowledge passed down by the royal family, they finally discovered the stone-carved halls. The halls were huge and the dwarves had to make camp close to a stone portal. Whilst they slept, the stone portal blazed with magical light, and a horde of evil drow charged them, led by Shindia Darkeyes. They fought valiantly, but were exhausted by their long weeks of travel. They finally managed to force the dark elves to retreat into the portal, but suffered enormous casualties in the process. In the battle, King Teirgoh was wounded by a poisoned dagger, and lay in eternal sleep. Unfortunately, their cleric could not do a thing. His only son, Prince Keirgar, was captured during the drow invasion. With no member of the royal family among them, Armun and the rest of the dwarves no longer had access to the secret royal knowledge.\n\nThe dwarves spent much time recovering from the devastating attack and luckily came across a band of adventurers. The party heard Armun out, who told them the story of his past. He told them that, when they are prepared, they will strike. However, he offered an alternative. If the party were to rescue Prince Keirgar and return him to them, he would pass on the information about the exits from the dwarven halls.\n\nIf the party accepted, Armun was grateful, and handed them a medallion made of stone. The medallion belonged to Shindia, who'd dropped it in the battle. This magical item was actually the key to the portal that previously sent hordes of evil creatures and drow to fight the dwarves. Before they headed off, he gave them instructions on the portal's usage, and told them that his ancestors would use them for quick transportation. He also told the adventurers  a legend about an oracle of knowledge, and the key to its operation was a powerful black orb. Here, the young dwarven warrior, Dorhum, joined the adventurers, if they so wished.",

There, they heard of a street brawl in which Vajra and her companions had beaten off some thugs attacking a drunken beggar, Priam Agrivar, outside the Inn of the Crescent Moon. The bounty seekers found two of the thugs, roughed them up, and demanded to know which way Vajra and her companions had gone. Though the thugs hoped for a share of the reward, the bounty seekers killed them once they had received their answer.\n\nThe bounty seekers tracked the adventurers on the way to Stoner's Needle and ambushed them as they returned. The leader threw a noose around Vajra's neck, the woman tossed a net over Timoth the centaur, and the barbarian caught both Cybriana and Onyx in his arms. However, they missed Priam Agrivar, who had left the group a short time before but saw the attack.\n\nThe bounty seekers placed Vajra in a cage on a cart and planned to return her to Manshaka and Duum. They intended to sell her companions into slavery, but Priam returned and intercepted the bounty seekers, passing a dagger to Vajra, and launched an ambush. As Priam tackled the barbarian, Vajra cut her way out of her cart, and the companions fought their way free. The warrior woman threatened Timoth before Vajra knocked her out. Onyx throttled the leader with his chain, then stole the key to their manacles.

If persuaded to reveal his lore, the spirit revealed that Myth Drannor was once an elven settlement, followed by its prosperity and its downfall. He then revealed that he'd died on the day that Myth Drannor was overwhelmed by monsters. He then gave a test to prove their worthiness of passing to Myth Drannor, which if failed would only make the pathway to Myth Drannor permanently blocked. If the test was passed, he unblocked the way, but told them not to cut down any more trees.",

However, Abarax surrendered to her, then swayed the paladin of Tyr with honeyed words and feigned apologies.

For headwear, men wore simple white linen caps that covered the tops of the ears, thick fur caps with earflaps when it was cold, and handsewn caps on festival days. Women were typically tightly bundled up in woolen dresses that were black or gray in color, and added colorful scarves, rainbow head-wraps, or ornate headpieces on special occasions. Servants also typically wore grey-and-black woolen garb. Tabotan noblemen donned dark silk gowns and arranged their hair in certain knots adorned with jewels, while noblewomen wore extravagant dresses bedecked with bells and chimes. Every child and every lama had shaved heads. Individual monasteries had their own distinct uniforms, such as monks in simple orange loincloths to temple guards in dark-green pants and blouses, to warrior priests with brass skullcaps bearing peacock feathers, and so on.\n\nAppreciating any game or sport with some element of risk, whether it was physical or financial, Tabotans enjoyed gambling and physical contests such as wrestling, roping yaks, and breaking in horses for bareback riding.\n\nA popular alcoholic beverage was co'wii, meaning \"cow's kick\". It was brewed from tubers and was quite strong, as the nickname attested. Another was mujahroom, brewed from figs.\n\nThe majority of peasants dwelled in simple tents and yurts, even in the towns, while a few possessed longhouses with sod-brick or tamped-earth walls and thatched roofs supported by a few rough-hewn wooden beams; these roofs were flat because of the limited rainfall. The houses of the nobility were two or three stories high and had tiled roofs raised above the building and a wide open attic.

Both a spiritual and political leader, the High Lord was the sole authority in the realm, whose word was law and decisions were final. The High Lord took counsel from only the Lon Chen, received petitions from the Council Kashag, and granted audiences to the Chi-kyap Khempo, who each in turn governed different aspects of the country. All the councils of Tabotan government met in the capital city at U'Chan Gompa, also known as Koko Nur. Circa Shou Year\u00a02607 (1357\u00a0DR), the High Lord was Ning D'Ahn. The High Lord was commonly believed to wield god-like powers and their symbol of authority was the Staff of Oceans.\n\nThe Lon Chen (translated as chief ministers) oversaw monastic matters and advised the High Lord, giving them direct influence. A yig-tsang, or monk council, sent delegates known as tse-khor to the Lon Chen. Circa 2607, the tse-khor were seen as corrupt and untrustworthy and the monk council was split over many issues. In particular, southern monasteries like Nafeen and Zotung Gompas complained strenuously about the High Lord's tithings and adopted radical stances, thus paralyzing the yig-tsang and presaging a separatist movement. The High Lord filled the Lon Chen with trusted northern monks, which only alienated the southerners further. One of the Lon Chen was Mo Kin, Abbot of Pokarr, who had the responsibility of patrolling Tabot's eastern border with Shou Lung.\n\nThe Chi-kyap Khempo (translated as lord chamberlain) represented the old nobility of Tabot. The nobles had no powers or authorities, and possessed only their hereditary titles and small estates within their historical kingdoms. Their only contact with the High Lord was via the Chi-kyap Khempo, who was appointed by the High Lord. Baron Phen Do bribed the Chi-kyap Khempo to aid his rebellion.\n\nThe Council Kashag comprised four members: one monk and three lay followers drawn from the peasantry. They oversaw secular matters via five distinct bureaucratic bodies: the Chi-gye Le-Khung or Foreign Bureau for international relations; the La-Cha or Treasurers for taxes and trade; the Mag-chi Le-Khung or Military Office for defense; the Tsong-Du or National Assembly as a public forum; and the Dzong-Pon or District Officers, who acted as sheriffs and policed their districts and were aided by deputies and assistant deputies. In practice, however, the dzong-pong could rule within their districts or might be puppets of local nobility.\n\nThe country of Tabot was divided by the Council Kashag into a number of districts, which were on much the same lines as the former baronies. Each of course was under a dzong-pon.",

                "paras": "The Way of Enlightenment (known elsewhere as the \"Path of Enlightenment\"), with its faith in the Celestial Emperor and the Celestial Heavens, was the state religion of the theocracy of Tabot. It was embodied in the High Lord of Oceans and in the fifteen gompas, or monasteries, that dominated the land. The great sages of the Celestial Empire were known in Tabot as Buddas or as boddas. This form of the faith was also followed by the Yellow Mountain Sect in Khazari and Tabotan gompas were established in Fatula Chupa, the City of Monasteries on the Katakoro Plateau. In Fatula Chupa, the Tabotan gompas and the Yellow Mountain monastery were in alliance.\n\nThe founding figure of this faith was the first High Lord of Oceans, H'Dang Li, who wrote his teachings down in works like the Puvarna. Fantastic legends were attributed to him. A sacred site of the faith was Mount Shun, where the Holy Mysteries of the faith unfolded, where the lances of Tabja Rung were forged, and where demons were defeated. An annual pilgrimage was undertaken to the site. The lamas commanded that the people follow certain codes of conduct; at their strictest, these included never imbibing alcohol or being in the same room as a women, which some people even followed.\n\nThe calendar was marked by many holy days and religious festivals and parades, with events running all through the year. Their scale, artistry, and grandiose nature were comparable to those of Shou Lung. The priests believed these displays brought joy to the peasants' otherwise boring lives. The Tabotan festival calendar was known to include the Qwa'chein Goh celebrations, the Wona Chu'ing festival in the middle of winter, and the Dui'yu festival to celebrate the harvest; the latter two were outdoors and the only time High Lords were glimpsed by the common folk. The Crystal Day commemoration was on the third day of the fifth month. On Penance Day, participants were temporarily released from all their vows. A winter month was known as Maki.\n\nIn particular, at the start of each year, the priests of U'Chan Gompa conducted a special ceremony in which they asked a question of the gods and burned a tortoise shell by placing it in cherry-red hot coals. From the markings that appeared, they divined the future. They inscribed their interpretations on the tortoise shells and hung them on the temple wall, so lamas and common folk alike could consult them and plan for the year ahead. Countless questions were asked of the gods in this way, and many influential people submitted their own questions.\n\nTabot was famous for its hermits, sages, oracles, and ascetics who lived in the mountains. It was said they had powerful visions, could predict the future, protected holy relics, and could raise heroes from the dead for good causes. A legend held that when a true oracle died, every bell in Lii Gompa would spontaneously ring nine times to help their soul travel to the Celestial Heavens. Circa Shou Year\u00a02607 (1357\u00a0DR), the monks recognized only five true oracles still living in the mountains who'd foretold events and resurrected the dead; they were Smirnk of the Willows of Hokla Mountain, Morka Fooztang from Noko-Ji Peak, Tzu Wan the Entrusted on the Marnu Cliffs, Ti Horr of Mount Wiz'tcu Tan, and the Forgotten One of Pojar Mountain. Most of the rest were dismissed as frauds and pretenders.\n\nThe common people, meanwhile, also believed in mighty spirits that lived in the mountains and that these should be acknowledged and appeased. They included the Wind Spirits that reigned over the Wu Pi Te Shar and the Great Cat, a power of law and vengeance recognized in the south. This was a remnant of the Black Leopard Cult and some legends of the Black Leopard were remembered there. Rumors claimed \"the frog and the snake\" were even worshiped in the twin cities of Motra and Joya.\n\nThey held that the souls of the deceased were absorbed into nearby stones and that a storm without rain brought good luck while one with rain brought bad luck. A common story was of the badger Hignog, who would disguise itself as a man and kidnap and devour naughty children; naturally, these were used to frighten misbehaving children. The monks dismissed such folklore as superstition.",

All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word.\n\nIn Shou Year\u00a0710 (\u2212540\u00a0DR), seven lamas of the Zotung Keep discovered a man frozen in ice on Mesku Peak. They recovered the man and defrosted him, but he melted away with the ice and in his place they found a male leopard cub. They raised the leopard and it grew as big as a horse. Finally, one day it even talked, and asked to be allowed to go free. Surprised, the lamas opened the gates to the leopard, which returned to Mesku Peak. Afterward, the new abbot of the new Zotung Gompa called on the leopard for help when making decisions, and since then, it was said to visit many lamas in dreams to dispense advice on the proper way to achieve enlightenment. The whole affair was declared a miracle, the first of the young nation.\n\nBut Tabot continued to be invaded by the forces of Shou Lung, with attempts in Shou Year\u00a0837 (\u2212413\u00a0DR), in Shou Year\u00a0859 (\u2212391\u00a0DR), and finally in Shou Year\u00a0894 (\u2212356\u00a0DR).

With the fate of their nation hanging in the balance, artisans in Ji fashioned the five crystalline warriors and a group of great dang-ki and wu jen animated them and gave them magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of Lokar Pass. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands. The crystalline warriors went into the mountains to await the day when Tabot again had need of them.

The monks saw the child as pure, born enlightened, and fully at one with the Celestial Heavens, as well as highly intelligent and capable of magical powers, even creating the great Staff of Oceans. Before long, the holy boy was recognized by all the monasteries and loved by the peasants, who gave him many presents.\n\nVery soon, the monasteries were reformed and united under the rule of the High Lord of Oceans, H'Dang Li.

They included Turkel Bastan, a potter, monk, and student of the teachings of Penpahg D'Ahn; and the family of the mother of Danica Maupoissant.\n\nGrowing as High Lord, Ning D'Ahn would have a turbulent reign. First, seeking to restore the nobility to power and depose the High Lord, Baron Phen Do of Khampo launched a rebellion, with an army nicknamed the \"Raccoon-dogs\" hiding in the mountains. In response, the worried Mag-chi Le-Khung stationed three divisions in Khampo.\n\nAt one point, Tabot sent an ambassadorial delegation to Shou Lung to propose a peace treaty. As part of negotiations, they invited the Shou to an important ceremony at the Temple of Heaven's Heart on Mount E'kwong. Desiring to visit Tabot, the Dragon Lord Mei Lung elected to attend in person, presumably in disguise.

Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in Bidnop So, Darka, Thok, and Khampo; accepted volunteers from among the temple guards; and hired mercenaries.\n\nMeanwhile, General Hiso Sing of T'u Lung invaded Shou Lung, north of the Tabotan border city of Joya. The Mag-chi Le-Khung feared any retreat would inevitably mean an invasion of Tabot, and started stationing forces along the southern border and even contemplated further conscription. In any case, T'u Lung sent a diplomatic mission to Tabot, its destination U'Chan Gompa. To curry favor with the High Lord, they transported a number of treasure chests and even a princess of the Wai clan, all escorted by fifty mounted soldiers.

Deder was not aware of the dagger's enchantments and kept it as a trophy until it was stolen by his flunkey, a fellow halfling, Kreshinal Blackhound. Kreshinal fled from departed Westgate for Selgaunt, moving the dagger with him, staying there for five years that followed.

Deder successfully eliminated many members of the rival faction of Selgaunt and reclaimed what was his.\n\nWhile Deder Seven Fingers was pouring all of his attention into routing the thieves of Selgaunt and returning the Salamander's Tongue, Sembian criminals hired Pieter the Feeble, a priest of Mask, to infiltrate and undermine Deder's operations. The priest successfully manipulated Westgate and Selgaunt thieves into crippling each other's organizations.

Unbeknownst to her, Vhok and the priest Zasian Menz discovered she was pregnant and concocted a plan to use that to their advantage. They explained the plan to her but put her under a geas and made her forget until the time was right. Aliiza was captured by the astral deva Tauran, a servant of Tyr, and sent to the House of the Triad in order to give her child a chance to live a life of good, and to give Aliisza a chance at redeeming herself for her evil deeds.\n\nWhile standing trial before the Guardian, the knowledge that she was with child was revealed to her for the first time. After hearing her child must remain in that heavenly realm, Aliisza felt a very uncharacteristic moment of sadness and fear of losing her child, and she agreed to remain in the House of the Triad in order to hopefully be one day reunited with her child. Her mind was imprisoned in a lonely duplicate of the House, where she roamed at will, experienced her vile deeds from an outside perspective, and was occasionally visited by Tauran, who tried to show her the error of her ways and to persuade her to the side of good. While her spirit was undergoing those personality-changing trials, Aliisza's body gave birth to her son, Kael, who was sired by the drow Pharaun Mizzrym (although Aliisza had expected it to be Vhok's child).\n\nUpon seeing her son for the first time (many years after his birth, although the time passed much more quickly for her), Aliisza's magically removed memories came flooding back and her body was switched with that of her son. In that form, she traveled to the lair of the storm dragon Tekthyrios and shoved mushrooms down his throat, allowing a portal from the Elemental Plane of Fire to open in his belly and allow Vhok and Zasian to pass through. In that moment, twelve years passed in the outside world, Kael and Tauran appeared, Aliisza was returned to her own body, and it was revealed that Zasian was a priest of Cyric intending to wreak havoc on the heavens.\n\nAliisza aided Vhok (geased into helping), Tauran, and Kael in hunting down Zasian. She later allied with Micus, who was hunting them, in an attempt to prevent Zasian and Kashada from stealing Azuth's staff, but failed and her friends felt she had betrayed them, although she redeemed herself by helping them later.\n\nAfter Cyric used Azuth's staff to slay Mystra, magic went awry and Aliisza suffered from the effects of the Spellplague, gaining incredible magic power fueled by consuming her own life force. She and her companions ended up in the company of demons fighting devils in a remnant of the Blood Rift. Vhok betrayed them there, joining up with the marilith Vhissilka, and so Aliisza was forced to come up with a plan to reach freedom. She took Pharaun's desiccated finger from inside her sword and used it to summon his soul to enter the soulless body of Zasian, who had become a Living Vessel. Pharaun used his magic to effect their escape, but they were promptly captured and imprisoned by agents of the House of the Triad. However, when the demon lord Axithar's legions began invading the plane, they were released and headed to the Lifespring to prevent Vhok from reaching it. Vhok plunged his sword into Aliisza's stomach, and as she told him that she had once loved him she used the last of her life force to cast a spell to stop his heart. She died in the arms of her son, and even the healing powers of the Lifespring could not heal her. As she was dying she gave Kael his father's ring.",

Also built before Wheloon's founding was a so-called citadel built into a bluff north of the site. Later ruined, nothing more than the crumbling foundations inhabited by displacer serpents would remain by the 1370s DR.\n\nOriginally a small thorp that lived off the trade of river crossings on the Wyvern Ferry Route, Wheloon slowly developed as trade along the Way of the Manticore increased and more ships starting using the Wyvernflow. It grew into a town based around the ferry. The Harvest Hall temple of Chauntea was built around this time.\n\nAlthough Wheloon sat at the crossing of two of Cormyr's most important travel routes, it usually played only a minor role in Cormyrean history prior to 1374 DR.\n\nIn the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR, King Galaghard III's army, the Glory of Cormyr, fought a battle against the Witch Lords and their undead forces at the fords of Wheloon, overrunning them but unable to achieve a final victory. They eventually drove them to the Vast Swamp and defeated them there. This was the last historical event significant to Cormyr to occur in Wheloon until 1374 DR.",

                "paras": "Wheloon was one of a number of places captured by the Lost King Gondegal in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR. Like the others, his mercenary troops occupied and pillaged the town before being ousted by the Purple Dragons as Gondegal's eight-day kingdom fell.\n\nDuring the Time of Troubles, in early Eleint of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, Cyric and some of his Zhentilar force visited Wheloon as they passed through Cormyr. Cyric left at least one of his agents there to interfere with Kelemvor Lyonsbane, Midnight, and Adon. Shortly after they arrived, Kelemvor was framed for the robbery and murder of a local merchant, with Cyric's agent testifying to Lord Redbeard that they had seen him leave the house with a bloody sword. When the Wheloon Watch tried to apprehend Kelemvor, the group fled on stolen horses, pursued by the Watch and the Purple Dragons, and made a successful getaway.\n\nDuring the Goblin War, the neighboring city of Arabel was evacuated in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. The refugees poured into Wheloon, rapidly increasing the population. They settled and built up the east bank, expanding Wheloon from a town to a small city in a few years.\n\nBy 1374 DR, an aging Lord Sarp Redbeard, once considered headstrong and almost independent of the crown, had proven his loyalty though a combination of trade deals and military actions. However, his main focus was still on the good of Wheloon.\n\nThe priestess Naedaenya Arthas met with Sarp Redbeard around Ches of 1374 DR to request the construction of a temple of Mystra in Wheloon. She persuaded him that it would open a market for magical items, spell components, and lore, and boost the city's economy. She also paid hefty bribes to Redbeard. He approved construction, and granted the priests tax breaks. He told Whelunians it would bring more people and trade and make Wheloon important. The temple was sited on the crumbling foundations of the ruined citadel that lay on the northern edge of town. Using magically assisted construction techniques, it took only months to build, and was nearly completed in Eleint that year. It was Cormyr's only temple to Mystra, but many Whelunians had little need to worship the goddess of magic, and it became only a local curiosity. Then, on Eleint 6, an itinerant cleric of Mystra, Tunaster Dranik, and a group of adventurers in the service of Mystra discovered the temple to be a front for Sharran cultists to kidnap magically gifted citizens and travelers in a plot to tear a rift in the Weave. Wheloon's Purple Dragons investigated the matter and Constal Maximanus Tholl brought the adventurers to an audience with Redbeard, who requested they continue their investigations and follow the cultists into the Vast Swamp. Redbeard, Tholl, and the Purple Dragons remained in Wheloon to guard the city and the temple. After pursuing the cult, the adventurers foiled the plot and returned on Eleint 13, and helped open up trade agreements between Cormyr and the Sharptooth tribe of lizardfolk in the Vast Swamp.",

                "paras": "After the Spellplague in the Year of the Heretic's Rampage, 1473 DR, King Foril decreed that Wheloon be transformed into a prison city, sentencing all those inside to be prisoners for life, sealed in by physical and magical barriers. The decision was made following unprecedented activity by worshipers of Shar in the city, as well as evidence of their alliance with Netheril. Suspected worshipers of Shar, Shadovar sympathizers and spies, and any others who offended the crown were put over the wall and left to survive on their own.\n\nBy the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, Wheloon was a dark prison city, no longer a trade hub, and the streets were controlled by gangs of thugs. Even so, a small group of nobles, courtiers, and priests of Chauntea and Lliira begun petitioning the Crown to open the city. They insisted the Purple Dragons couldn't prove all the imprisoned were faithful of Shar and believed that the children born since the city was sealed ought to be given the chance at a righteous life.\n\nWheloon was originally only lightly populated, beginning as a town of 1,500 people circa 1367 DR, but refugees from Arabel changed that, causing a small population explosion. It rose rapidly to around 3,700 circa 1370 DR, and then to a small city of 6,661 people in 1372 DR and leveling at 6,692 in 1374 DR. However, Lord Redbeard kept poor records of the number of people in Wheloon and other lands he governed, meaning that the population figures were also notoriously uncertain.[note 1]\n\nIt had a mixed population, consisting of 82% humans, 6% halflings, 4% dwarves, 4% gnomes, 2% half-elves, 1% elves, and 1% half-orcs.\n\nFollowing Wheloon's transformation into a prison city after the Spellplague, Wheloon's population fell to 3,000 by 1479 DR.\n\nThe Lord of Wheloon through the mid\u201314th century was Lord Sarp Redbeard, who ruled in the name of King Azoun IV. He was famously headstrong and acted virtually independently of the crown. He often disagreed with the crown's policies, usually refusing to support them if they did not benefit Wheloon. Redbeard was popular and well-liked by his people, who felt he kept the Purple Dragons from meddling in their affairs too much. The Whelunians respected his focus on them and their city. Redbeard also often sided with the many farmers who dwelt in his domain, so he was popular among them as well.\n\nDue to Redbeard's poor population records, the taxes paid to the crown fluctuated. He was generally negligent on taxation and tended to ignore the contribution of smugglers to the local economy.\n\nThe Heralds of Faer\u00fbn had an office here, titled \"Wheloon\". In the 1350s and 60s DR, this position was filled by Elaerue Estspirit, who also served as assistant, clerk, and record-keeper to Redbeard.\n\nThe Huntcrown noble house had holdings in Wheloon.\n\nA magistrate based here ruled on legal disputes, both in Wheloon and in other settlements in Redbeard's domain, like Ghars.\n\nSprawling on both sides of a river, and with no town walls or natural barriers, Wheloon was difficult to defend.\n\nThe Wheloon Watch was a militia force of volunteers, all merchants and tradesmen by day. They were basic fighters, equipped with leather armor, maces, short swords, daggers, and crossbows. They were based out of the Wheloon Watch House.\n\nThe Purple Dragons enforced law and order in Wheloon. Their force in the city numbered approximately 150, and they were led by Constal Maximanus Tholl around 1374 DR. A typical road patrol numbered fourteen and consisted of mounted fighters equipped with chain mail, light lances, longswords, maces, and daggers. Around 1358 DR, a patrol leader was Roadcaptain Thondar. They had a barracks and armory near the Wheloon Watch House.[note 2]\n\nAs a prison city in the 15th century, Wheloon at last had a wall built around it, albeit to keep the people in.\n\nWheloon lay at the intersection of the two most valuable and heavily trafficked trade routes in eastern Cormyr: the Way of the Manticore from Sembia and the Wyvernflow river between the Wyvernwater and the Sea of Fallen Stars. The town grew and prospered off the Wyvern Ferry that linked both sides of the river, as merchant caravans, barges, and ships increasingly passed through or offloaded their cargo here, and it served as a barge transshipment center. Through the late 1360s DR, Wheloon became a cheaper and less crowded alternative to the ports of Suzail and Marsember.\n\nIt was a busy and prosperous town, ever growing through the 1360s DR, with wealth and entrepreneurs, known as \"hothands\". There was strong competition between shopkeepers and craftsfolk. Though there were no major merchants, the talented craftsfolk often allied to invest in new ventures. Cut-price transportation services were a favorite, though they had to hire guards to defend themselves from bandits hired by established costers trying to crush the upstart competition.\n\nThere was a big population of artisans and craftsfolk in Wheloon, who were famous for the quality of their work, thanks to their attention to detail and great patience at their craft. They included many boatmakers and sailmakers, and basketweavers and clay-potters, as well as as wagonwrights.\n\nLocal agriculture was established in the farming of apples, blueberries, grapes, melons, peaches, pumpkins, raspberries, and wheat. Wheloon's port shipped out more bulk food and grain than anywhere else in Cormyr, and returned hefty profits. Among others, one new trade in Wheloon at the time was the breeding and training of bluebirds and ferrets for pets. These animals grew in popularity in Cormyr in the 1360s DR. In the lumber industry, Whelunians extensively logged the Hermit's Wood. A local \"hothands\", Sarliman Eurdoe, imported the rosecork from Prespur for its valued properties. The rosecork trees went on to flourish by the southern tributaries of the Wyvernflow.\n\nFollowing the Spellplague and Wheloon's transformation into a prison city, it naturally stopped being a trade hub.\n\nWheloon was an industrious, busy, and prosperous place. Whelunians were often going about some business and traveling to one place or another within the town. Most were hardworking craftsfolk who, though not rich, earned enough money and had enough time on their hands to enjoy their lives. Whelunian craftsfolk had an eye for fine detail and great patience for a task, and these traits were exhibited in the finished goods. These craftsfolk were famous for the quality of their work, and their reputation spread to distant lands.\n\nUnfortunately, they were preyed upon by the many thieves of Wheloon. These thieves shared the craftsmen's eye for detail, composure, and methodical nature. It took them longer to pick a lock than a typical thief, but they could do so more reliably.\n\nMost deceased Whelunians were buried in the Green, a field outside town. However, some buried their family members on their own property, in small, private cemeteries. For centuries, Whelunians used Rathool's Pond as a burial site for war heroes and those slain in battle, though they'd discontinued the practice by the mid\u201313th century DR.\n\nFollowing Wheloon's transformation into a prison city, it became a dumping ground for suspected Shar-worshipers, Shadovar spies and sympathizers, and others who'd offended the Cormyrean rulers, as well as those already trapped inside. They were left to look after themselves, and life was hard and dangerous. For protection, people gathered into gangs. There were many of these gangs, all rivals, often ruthless, and they ruled the streets and dominated the town.\n\nThese Whelunians bitterly resented Cormyr for abandoning them, but also despised self-righteous do-gooders, and believed all people had darkness in them. They were loyal only to other members of their gang, or an adopted group, and uncaring of outsiders. They were often skilled in thievery and in resisting charm magic. A common mark of a Whelunian was their tattoos, both the prisoner tattoos made before they were put over the walls and the gang tattoos earned inside. These could be extensive and recorded their ordeals. They marked escapees, and had to be disguised elsewhere in Cormyr.\n\nEscaping was very difficult, so much so that \"to escape from Wheloon\" came to mean to accomplish a difficult task. However, it was not impossible. Those who escaped lived in fear of recapture, and usually tried to find a new home far outside Cormyr.",

The eastern side grew later, especially when it was settled by refugees of Arabel. Without town walls or other natural barriers to contain it, the town sprawled outwards in all directions. The terrain beneath was hilly, so the meandering streets wound around them, or followed the whims of Whelunian builders, as there was no attempt at urban planning. The streets were cobbled and patched, and often muddy. Road-lamps provided light to Wheloon's streets after dark.\n\nWealthy and fast-growing, Wheloon did not have many permanent buildings, and few stood out as especially grand or particularly rundown. Still, they were always growing, expanding, and improving. Most were built of stone, and some had upper stories of stucco and timber. Others were fashioned of wood or wattle.\n\nMany of Wheloon's businesses and houses were roofed with bright green slate shingles.

This native slate was dark green when first cut, but brightened on exposure to the sun. Travelers were often impressed by the vibrant green roofs, and the buildings were nicknamed \"the jade towers of Wheloon\" and the city itself the \"Jade Towers\". A few other buildings and warehouses had thatched roofs instead.\n\nWhelunians built their own houses and operated small businesses from them. Bedrooms and kitchens often doubled as workshops as a result. Still, they were proud of their homes, whatever they were made from or did in them, and often worked on improving them.\n\nWheloon was always seen to be a busy place, with people traveling back and forth on business, while drovers moving animals and merchant caravans often came through. It was noisy with the sounds of labor, of wagons and animals, of people talking and calling. Such things went on through the day and deep into the night.\n\nThe greatest landmark in Wheloon was the Wyvernflow River that divided it in two. The Wyvern Ferry Route operated ferries over the water, joined the two halves of the town together and linking both ends of the Way of the Manticore. With heavy traffic and many Whelunians owning boats, fares remained cheap at one copper piece, and ferries ran day and night. Two inns lay on opposite ends of the ferry route: the Wyvern Watch Inn on the west bank and the Lantern Inn and Boathouse on the east.\n\nOn the west bank, the Way of the Manticore crossed Wheloon Way, with the Wheloon Watch House, the Purple Dragon barracks, Wheloon Jail, and the armory all standing on one corner of the intersection. North up Wheloon Way could be found Oldstone Hall, the lord's manor, standing opposite the Wheloon Moothouse, which, unfortunately, lay near Haldos's Fine Butchery. Another key road in town was Westbank March, a farm road that ran from the heights north of Wheloon down to follow the Wyvernflow to the coast. Impil Street was the site of many warehouses owned by the Cormyrean Coins Coster.\n\nThe Green was a large field southwest of the town. The majority of deceased Whelunians were buried in the Green, but small herds of livestock, owned by a few city-folk, were also allowed to graze there. The Green was ringed by a communally owned wooden fence.\n\nRathool's Pond lay within the town, on its northwestern side. For centuries, Whelunians used it as a burial site for war heroes and those slain in battle. The water turned orange-brown with rust from their armor and weapons. By the mid\u201313th century DR, Rathool's Pond was the local swimming pool and fishing hole, but it was considered unsafe for drinking or fishing.

Unknown to them, they were sponsored by Calimshan's syl-pasha Rashid yn Yusef el Djenispool and the King of Tethyr, Alemander IV. The two regents acted in concert with the goal of killing the king's brother, the paladin-prince Rythan.\n\nUnbeknownst to either ruler, they were both doing the dirty work of the Twisted Rune who wanted revenge against Prince Rythan for killing the lich Jhaniloth Puiral. Rythan led a small army to meet Mulsparkh's mercenary armies of humanoids and men, armed with the Lion's Sword, but they were defeated in the Battle of Nightflames, which claimed the life of the noble prince. Successful in their scheme, syl-pasha Rashid and the Rune ceased their covert support of Mulsparkh, whose armies quickly deserted. Troops from Memnon annihilated any who remained and put an end to the short-lived realm.\n\nNow that his brother was dead, King Alemander could rule without any familial interference. He implemented draconian laws that soon inspired dissent in the citizenry. Two of his dukes, the Duke of Dusk and the Duke of Suretmarch revealed themselves to be utter tyrants while others just became much more harsh in their treatment of subordinates. The persecution of the elves that had gone on for the last century intensified and the increasingly greedy crown prince Alemander V was taking advice from minor nobles that contradicted his fathers wishes, in a seemingly petty attempt of antagonization.\n\nSince at least 1340 DR, Rashid plotted with Tethyr's General Nashram Sharboneth to supplant King Alemander and deliver Tethyr into Calishite hands, as the lands existed during the years of the Shoon Imperium. They sought to incite riots against Tethyr's nobility and manipulate crown prince Alemander into starting a coup against the king, with the aim that the forces of Calimshan could cross the border and have its army act as \"peacekeepers\". Prince Alemander V was easily convinced and began setting up his coup for early in the summer of 1347 DR.\n\nGeneral Sharboneth had been receiving massive monetary resources from Rashid for seven years when he decided to betray both the syl-pasha and the prince, promising land and titles to his officers if they supported him in his own coup to take control. One of the officers remained loyal to Rashid and told him of the double-cross, whereupon Rashid convinced a Doommaster of Beshaba named Dlatha Faenar to hex Sharboneth's forces. Beshaba herself was accordingly incensed that Rashid would try and control bad luck, so she plagued Calimshan with misfortune for the duration of the Interregnum so that its forces could never march north.",

Northern nobles, wealthy merchants, mercenaries and adventurers were allowed to purchase land and titles in exchange for defending them from more despotic would-be rulers and roaming bands of monsters.\n\nIn 1356 DR, any missing persons and mysterious deaths were often blamed on the fiendish battles that centered around Dragonspear Castle in the Western Heartlands.\n\nThe near constant fighting was only interrupted by events that impacted all of Faer\u00fbn such as the Time of Troubles. During the Avatar Crisis, armies allegedly led by the Red Knight were very effective at putting down a growing monster horde in the Forest of Tethir. The invasion of the Tuigan Horde saw many mercenaries leave the nation to join the wealthier army of Cormyr,providing a little peace for the peasantry of Tethyr. The discovery of Maztica caused most of the warring factions to put aside their conflicts and rush to build boats so that they could plunder the riches of the New World. None of these expeditions actually made it to New Amn however and all the effort and manpower put into them was wasted.\n\nGoodly adventuring companies and the elves of Tethir played major roles in restoring a modicum of peace and justice to the land.

However their protection could not be secured by any governing body, and individual landowners were responsible for the safety of their lands. By this time, life in cities such as Zazesspur, Myratma and Saradush began to return to somewhat normalcy whereas Ithmong and the outlying settlements were still plagued by dissent and conflict.\n\nIn the Year of the Helm, the Chaos Curse killed nearly all the scholars within the Edificant Library while the monastery itself was destroyed in a months-long siege by the forces of Talona.\n\nIn 1364 DR, the mercenary Bunlap ran a logging operation in the eastern part of Forest of Tethir, during which his loggers enslaved and killed many elves. His crimes were stopped by the Harper agent Arilyn Moonblade of Evereska,[note 1] in an series of battles that came to be known as the Tethir Conflicts. These conflicts drew the attention and ire of the elves of Evermeet, which had become the de facto authority for Faer\u00fbnian elves during the Retreat. A stern letter from Queen Amlaruil Moonflower of Evermeet effectively ended Tethyr's persecution of the elves of the Wealdath.",

Among the many properties of the Harp of Stars, it could record the memories of malaugrym who used it, thus if it could reveal a great deal about the shapeshifters plans and society. However, the Harp of Stars was lost or destroyed at the conclusion of the war.\n\nThey continued until the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR, when Khelben claimed control over the mind of the malaugrym leader, the Shadowmaster, and compelled the malaugrym to disengage from the Material Plane. By this time, only a handful of the most powerful malaugryms had survived, and only about twenty Harpers remained.\n\nWhen the Harper veterans of the war came back to Faer\u00fbn, they found the Harpers under the influence of the lich Thavverdasz, the self-styled Harper King, and fighting with the Cult of the Dragon. In the last battles, Thavverdasz was destroyed by the Zulkir of Thay, Szass Tam. Szass Tam was subsequently defeated by Elminster, and the Harpers now found themselves opposed to Thay.",

Although Mourngrym had been sent from Waterdeep by Khelben Arunsun for other reasons, Doust recognized and admired his honesty and ambition to help protect Shadowdale, and was inspired to pass on the lordship.\n\nA few years later, in 1355 DR, a diplomatic envoy from Cormyr named Shaerl Rowanmantle was sent by Vangerdahast to investigate why the last two lords of Shadowdale were both \"chosen\" by Khelben. Shortly after her arrival in Shadowdale, Mourngrym fell in love with the young spirited and beautiful thief. The Lord's feelings were reciprocated but Mourngrym could not approve of Shaerl's profession. That conflict led the couple to drift apart. Subsequently, Shaerl and Mourngrym found themselves facing against an overwhelming horde of fiends from Myth Drannor. The beautiful and brave thief sacrificed her life to save Mourngrym's, and with her gone, he came to terms with his deep love for Shaerl. He avenged her death and embarked on a long quest to have his love resurrected. Eventually, he succeeded and was reunited with Shaerl. Soon after in 1355 DR, they were married.\n\nIn 1357 DR, Mourngrym became acquainted with the hero Alias and her companions Olive Ruskettle, Akabar Bel Akash, and Dragonbait, after the adventurers broke Shadow Gap's occupation by the Iron Throne. The mountain pass was guarded by a monstrous Kalmari, effectively stopping the trade with Shadowdale. Lord Mourngrym extended Alias the gratitude of Shadowdale.\n\nIn 1358 DR, three years after their marriage, Shaerl was pregnant with Mourngrym's son. One night, the Lord of Shadowdale was busy supervising Elminster and his new guests: Dwalimar Omen and Foxilon Cardluck. During the meeting, Foxilon wandered off inside Elminster's Tower and accidentally released a magically trapped assassin. Mourngrym and Elminster's guests were holding the hulking creature off when he attacked very pregnant Shaerl and attempted to take her hostage. The assassin did not expect the woman to be able to defend herself. The Lady of Shadowdale elbowed the assassin in the stomach and knocked him out with a punch. The stress of the fight caused her to go into labor shortly after. Luckily, her husband, Elminster, and Foxilon were able to deliver her child. The baby was named Scotti.\n\nMourngrym was nearly killed by the avatar of the god Bane when the second battle of Shadowdale broke out during the Time of Troubles that same year. The lord of Shadowdale was saved by his sergeant-at-arms Mayheir Hawksguard.\n\nWhen the adventurers Midnight and Adon were brought in under suspicion of murdering the Old Sage Elminster following the battle, Mourngrym was devastated but fulfilled his duty and presided over their trial. While he wound up serving as a witness by their defender in court Thurbal. In the end, Mourngrym found them guilty and sentenced them to death. Fortunately, the adventurers escaped their fate when they were \"rescued\" by their companion Cyric.\n\nMourngrym finally met his match in the summer of 1375 DR when his body was possessed by Yder Tanthul. Despite his rescue from this state, Mourngrym became depressed at his inability to protect himself and his people and offered to step down as lord of Shadowdale. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba over to Azalar Falconhand and rejoined the Knights of Myth Drannor.",

Aldlas believed that he had complete control over all three of them, though he was actually being manipulated into that belief by Aulmpiter. The four together were unstoppable until they came within a few hundred yards of Cormanthyr where the Elves had arrayed an organized army. The battle lasted for a whole day but eventually Gaulguth and Malimshaer were almost slain, Aulmpiter was subdued and Aldlas had been killed in a spell duel with the Grand Mage of the city.[citation\u00a0needed]\n\nThe nycaloths were imprisoned using the N'Quor'Khaor ritual which created an invisible, undetectable sub-dimensional prison high above the city. The three yugoloths were trapped there, unable to do anything at all, none of their abilities worked and all of their equipment became inert and useless. A sequencer key was set up to the prison with the condition being that a \"red dragon that never knew malice or greed in its heart flies over the Coronal's throne.\" would release the prisoners. Floating a mile above Cormanthyr they were forced to watch as the city grew and their names were relegated to stories meant to frighten children.",

The two were the closest of friends and nigh inseparable, often flying above the forest to keep up to date on news from the outlying settlements. Unbeknownst to them, this act was continually weakening the prison that held the nycaloths until it was weak enough for them to shatter it. A flind shaman, living north of the Dragon Sea enacted a summoning ritual at roughly the same time as their escape. The yugoloths teleported to it immediately upon escaping so that none would realize that they were gone. After eight months, they had slain the shaman that summoned them after misleading him that they were under his control. They immediately set upon putting a plan into action that they had been working on for nearly two millennia.[citation\u00a0needed]\n\nThe trio organized a massive army of orcs goblinoids, trolls, and gnolls from Thar and the northlands, training them into strict military precision. They summoned lesser yugoloths to act as officers, creating a horde that numbered in the thousands. It was called the Army of Darkness.[citation\u00a0needed]\n\nIn a three-year long war known as the Weeping War, all of the generals on both sides of the conflict were killed.

Usually such constructions were common in the Purang, while the Seng of Laothan had more impressive buildings. For example, a noble's house would be built from strong wood delivered from the rainforest, and many of these homes could reach two stories. Some foundations for defenses in Laothan were made out of stone but the buildings themselves were crafted of wood.\n\nIn the Kuong Kingdom, most of the buildings in villages were made of wood or bamboo, and raised above the ground for protection from wild animals and monsters. In the cities, the majority of homes were made of strong wood and the houses of nobles or important public buildings were built out of stone. Usually, the stone was quarried far away from cities and hauled back over many miles. Many stone buildings were often painted and had beautiful murals. The central core of a city was a temple around which were placed less important buildings such as shops and taverns. Temples were usually the most beautiful buildings in the city.

At the same time, Yama settled the land with people and animals and looked after their affairs.

The aliens were a pacifistic faction of the race known as the Nubari, whose utopian planets, which had been shared with other species in other crystal spheres, had all become embroiled in war. These Nubari used their powerful magic to create the Malatran Plateau as a safe haven where they could live in harmony with the native spirit folk and natural predators, determining that it would not be a desirable place for the other native peoples of Toril to live.\n\nThey weren't entirely correct. Humanity found its way into Malatra. The expansionist Kuong Kingdom, the tribal Seng of Laothan, and the primitive hill tribes of Purang all made inroads into the nation from the north, though the magical hallucinatory terrain and antipathy spells the Nubari had erected over the plateau, in conjunction with the sheer height of the plateau itself and the dinosaurs that lived around its base, dictated exactly how much contact there would be between the two races on the Nubari's terms.\n\nThe Nubari transplanted their utopian culture to their new home and lived in peace and near-solitude for millennia. The goddess Beshaba however, despised utopias and caused a disaster\u2014the nature of which has been lost to time\u2014to befall the Nubari. The Nubari lost the vast majority of their knowledge, culture, and technology in the disaster and soon devolved to primitive barbarism.\n\nDuring a long lull in the local predator population years afterward, human, korobokuru, and hengeyokai explorers managed to reach the plateau despite its magical defenses. The humans and the Nubari interbred, creating a new subrace of humans, and the korobokuru and hengeyokai thrived too. It is thought that the saru evolved from the gorilla population around this time as well, but no one can be sure as many from the other races did not immediately notice the difference in the primates' level of intelligence. The predator population was eventually restored, effectively isolating the humanoids on the plateau from the wider nation.\n\nAway from the plateau, the peoples of Malatra warred among themselves and with T'u Lung, with the Kuong Kingdom acting most frequently as the aggressor. Since 1307 DR, there was a lasting peace. This wasn't necessarily a good thing for Laothan, however, as without a common foreign foe to fight, their nobles began fighting among themselves instead. However, unknown to them, the Kuong were just using those five decades to build up their military for yet another attempt to expand into Laothan.\n\nAt some point in the 14th century DR, Aurora sent field agents to Malatra to set up lines of trade for culinary goods for her emporium and catalogue. Through these lines of trade she was able to sell the land's peppers and garum.",

She later succumbed to madness because of the grief of having lost all her family, dying shortly thereafter. The child, now the last surviving member of the Alagondar bloodline, was adopted by the Waterdhavian house Thann and raised as one of their own.\n\nIn the late years of the 15th century DR, many adventurers claimed to be that lost heir of Neverwinter, but most of them were put to the sword by Dagult Neverember, who would not suffer the presence of a bothersome claimant to his \"rightful throne\".\n\nAnother legend told about the lost Crown of Neverwinter, a magic crown that only a true heir of the Alagondar line could use. People that didn't have Alagondar blood were killed on the spot by the magic item if they attempted to use it.\n\nLikewise, it was believed that the ghosts of the Neverwinter Nine would only kneel before a true heir of the Alagondar bloodline.\n\nIt is rumored that Lady Tanamere Alagondar's Dragon Slayer longsword was buried with her in a barrow near Neverwinter.",

Many of the kingdom said the crown was the source of the Nentyarch's success and Tharos' prosperity.\n\nFollowing their acquisition and donning of the crown, the Nentyarch proclaimed the creation of the \"Empire of Narfell\" and began to conquer one all the kingdoms of the Nars. His war ended in the realm of Ashanath with the complete and utter destruction of its capital city, Shandaular.

Upon the wearer's death would the crown extract their living soul and transform their body into a crown-wraith. As the centuries continued on, and the crown was passed from one Nentyarch of the empire to another, it's powers magnified. In \u2212623\u00a0DR, after a failed invasion into the land of Mulhorand, the armies of Narfell were attacked by the forces of Raumathar. To avoid defeat, and the fall of their empire, the nobles of Narfell sought the aid of demons and accessed the art of sorcery, which were brought out by whisperings of the crown.\n\nBy \u2212150\u00a0DR the Crown of Narfell had grown dark and powerful with the souls of the ruling class it had absorbed over 700 years. It began further corrupting the Narfelli royal court, guiding them to consort with fiends and outright ruled over the following Nentyarchs.

                "paras": "Akabar Bel Akash was born in Turmish and spent most of his life trading on behalf of his wealthy family's trading business - House Akash led in big part by Akabar's first wife Kasim. The family traded in fine weaves and spices. The House Akash's business was run by Akabar's wives as was the Turmish tradition, and by 1357 DR they were looking for a new wife to joining the family endeavor. Traditionally men, and Akabar himself, were little more than a face for their wives\u0092' enterprises.\n\n1357 DR changed his peaceful and somewhat monotonous life. He felt a desire to have one great adventure before he got too old. These events started with a fateful delivery of fine weaves to Dimswart Manor, north of Suzail in preparation for a noble wedding. The trading caravan was destroyed by an ancient red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco, who snatched one of the wagons with Akabars spellbook and a halfling \"bard\" Olive Ruskettle on board.\n\nEscaping with his life, the Turmishman ended up in The Hidden Lady, an inn in Suzail. This is where Akabar's path crossed with amnesiac sellsword Alias. The woman's arm was adorned with a mysterious shimmering magical azure bonds tattoo. The merchant-mage attempted to work a detect magic spell to confirm the origin of the blue tattoos resulted in a violent explosion of blue light. Alias fled the inn and unsuccessfully sought aid at a temple. Akabar was intrigued by the magical tattoos and felt the sellsword's need for help. He followed her and visited the same temple Alias did after her departure.\n\nTheir paths crossed again but this time tightly intertwined when Alias and her saurial companion Dragonbait headed to meet the Sage of Suzail, Dimswart. The same man who Akabar was friends with and was bringing wedding silks to. Dimswart offered information on Alias' sigils in exchange for the missing bard's rescue mission. Akabar was the part of the destroyed caravan and followed the dragon to her lair so he knew of a secret way in, and he used that knowledge to accompany Alias and Dragonbait.\n\nTogether they freed the halfling \"bard\" from Mist's cage and managed escape unscathed. On the way back to the Manor they faced a crystalline monster created by one of Alias' evil masters. The group delivered Olive in time for the wedding reception, which they all attended. During the event, Akabar witnessed the azure bonds' dominating magic when Alias was forced to attack one of the guests (thinking he was Azoun Obarskyr IV) and then fleeing. Instead of cutting his losses and going home, Akabar retrieved the information Dimswart was to find for Alias and headed headfirst into adventure. He was fired up with the lust for adventure and wanted to help the new friend. Accompanied by Dragonbait and Olive they caught up with Alias and together set out to free her from the azure bonds.\n\nTogether they traveled through Shadow Gap, freed it from the Iron Throne's occupation, defeated a monstrous Kalmari, and visited Alias' old haunts in Shadowdale. There they received accolades from the lord of Shadowdale himself, Mourngrym Amcathra, and Akabar attempted to meet with Elminster but was held up in a bureaucratic nightmare by Elminster's scribe Lhaeo overnight.\n\nThe group continued to Yulash where they awoke the Abomination of Moander, another of Alias' evil masters. Akabar was captured and possessed by the Abomination, and for a time, was linked with the god's mind. When Dragonbait rescued the mage, Akabar was almost broken by the experience, but eventually, the feeling grew into steeled determination. He became highly proficient in wielding his magics in battle, helping the destruction of Moander's avatar.\n\nThe Battle took the heroes from Yulash to Cormanthor, only to come to the explosive win in the skies over Westgate. Catching a short breather, they were captured by the rest of Alias' masters: the evil wizard Cassana, lich Zrie Prakis, and a strange beholder-like demon Phalse. Cassana was planning to use Akabar as a puppet consort, tried to break his will, using her control over Alias to make the sellsword woman beat the mage to an inch oh his life. With the help of Olive, and Alias' \"father\" Nameless Bard, the heroes confronted the masters, destroying all three of them in a long and fierce battle that took them to the Citadel of White Exile.\n\nFollowing his life-changing big adventure, Akabar returned to the calm life if a trader. But the routine of life would be disrupted again the same year, four months later. While trading in the village of Hap, the town was taken over by the forces of a dracolich Crimdrac, a minion of a Red Wizard Dracandros. Akabar joined forces with a group of adventurers that possessed all too familiar azure bonds.\n\nAccompanied by the azure-bonded adventurers, Akabar reunited with Alias, Dragonbait, and Olive, once more to stop the new masters' alliance, Fire Knives, Tyranthraxus, cultists of Moander, while traveling to Yulash, Tilverton, Zhentil Keep, Haptooth Hill, and Myth Drannor.\n\nBy 1358 DR Akabar married a third wife, Zhara, a priestess of Tymora. However, it was discovered that she was a clone of Alias. Akabar and his new wife traveled to Shadowdale to inform Alias of Akabar's nightmares of Moander's return. He was committed to destroying the god once and for all. Alias' relationship with her newfound sister began on a wrong foot due to Alias dislike of clerics and her child-like jealousy over Akabar.\n\nFinder Wyvernspur's appeal in front of the tribunal of Harpers was happening in Shadowdale. When the session started, a saurial wizard Grypht teleported into the courtroom. Thinking they were under attack Harpers retaliated, driving the saurial toward's Finder's cell. Olive was there trying to rescue her friend. The trio was attacked by a Harper bard Kyre, who was enslaved by the Seed of Moander. Kyre stole the Finder's Stone, imprisoned the saurial, but Finder and Olive escaped by teleporting away. When Alias and the guard reached the Finder's cell, Kyre accused Grypht of kidnapping the Bard. While Alias and Dragonbait were hunting the alleged kidnapper, Akabar was charmed by Kyre, as she forced him to aid in Moander's return. Eventually, Akabar was able to break the spell and freed the saurial wizard. Together they retrieved the Finder's Stone and killed Kyre, realizing that nothing was left of the Harper as she was hollowed out from the inside by Moander's rotting vines. Alias and Dragonbait were joined by Zhara tracking Grypht. The heroes found out that Moander brought an enslaved saurial colony to the Realms. Alias reunited with Akabar and Grypht after battling Moander's rotten treants. The red-headed sellsword recovered the Finder's Stone, lost a year ago in a battle with Moander and was able to tap into the Stone's power to teleport everyone to the its creator, Finder. Akabar helped Alias in rescuing her father and Olive from orcs and Moander's rotted enslaved beholder.\n\nThe Finder's Stone teleported them to the Lost Vale where enslaved saurials were building a body for the new Abomination of Moander. There Dragonbait was captured by Coral his mate, who was controlled by the Seed of Moander. Alias and Akabar were captured to be sacrificed to bring moander back into the Realms. Dragonbait rescued his sister but Akabar managed to retain his own will and was sent to Moander's home plane of the Abyss, followed by Finder. In the end, his body overtaken by Moander's vines of possession, Akabar called to the gods he'd served through his life to take him into their hands, to teach Finder Wyvernspur how an unselfish man dies. Finder Wyverspur used the Finder's Stone's magic to obliterate Moander. Finder did not perish, instead, he absorbed the defeated god's divinity and ascended to godhood himself.",

Second, the wand could end any protection from evil spell or harm a good person with heat; this ability cost two charges. Third, the user could summon a nightmare for nine minutes.

Fourth, the wand could cast animate dead on one corpse of 7 feet (2.1 meters) in size or smaller, which served for six minutes. It cost four charges to animate the corpse again after these six minutes. The fifth ability, which only one in ten of the wands had, was the ability to summon an undead shadow.

He found little sucess as a Banite priest, and enthusiastically joined the Cyricist faith in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR. It was then that he began to enjoyed success for the first time.\n\nIn the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR, Akhelmere and Tellvon Bloodshoulder served as generals in battle against Bane's Black Hands at the recently-constructed Twin Towers in the Small Teeth. While the two priests managed to secure the eastern tower in Cyric's name, Tellvon was mysteriously killed in the siege. Akhelmere went to capture the west tower and secured the fortress in its entirety, claiming it for his own sect of Amnian Cyricism. No other leaders of the Cyricist army survived to challenge him.\n\nWhen the Sothillisian War broke out in Amn in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, Akhelmere aligned his temple with the Sothilisian Empire, even going so far to avail the oni-led armies with Cyricist faithful during the siege of Murann in the month of Tarsakh. While this plan was not entirely successful, the fear and mistrust it spread across Amn pleased Cyric.\n\nWhen the Rage of Dragons wreaked havoc across the Realms in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, the Amnian church of Cyric received a devastating blow. During the series of catastrophic dragon attacks, the Twin Towers were nearly entirely destroyed by the blue great wyrm Iryklathagra. Fortunately, Blackwill Akhmelere recovered the Calishite artifact known as the Golden Lamp of Samesaj, and used it to repair Cyric's greatest temple to its full glory. In the eyes of the faith, any record of an offense to Cyric was stricken from the records of history.",

Convinced that it was a mission from his goddess, Beriand joined the expedition to Myth Drannor, along with other adventurers who answered Elminster's call for aid against the Cult of the Dragon that planned to use the ruins' mythals and the Pools of Radiance to conquer the region. Beriand and Faeril, an elven fighter-cleric, along with a few others, arrived at the ruins from Elven Court.\n\nBeriand's group was ambushed by orcs and a fire-breathing creature who slaughtered most of the adventurers. Thankfully, Faeril managed to drag the bling cleric away from danger. Together, the two survivors found shelter in Stillwater Ruins, behind the protection of an elven word of power. Even though Beriand survived, the Deathbane staff was lost to the attackers. Faeril kept the blind cleric safe with her life.\n\nEventually, a group of adventurers from Phlan, later known as the Veiled Ones, arrived at the ruins to join the forces opposing the cult. Beriand requested their aid with recovering Deathbane, in exchange he provided them with the elven word of power that granted entrance to the Dwarven Dungeons underneath Myth Drannor, provided them with information on Elminster's hero Athan's wetherbouts, and aided the heroes with his healing abilities.\n\nThe group from Phlan managed to recover the staff from the orc marauders and returned it to the blind cleric. Soon after, they secured the shine of Mystra in the ruins, prompting Faeril to join the heroes in their quest.",

These four were the ancestors for a new group of arctic dwarves who became known as the Innugaakalikurit.\n\nIn the year Year of Quiet Thunder, \u2212598 DR, the Innugaakalikurit discovered a crude catapult on a high peak in Novularond; they disassembled the mechanism and brought the components home. A day later, a furious group of frost giants arrived after following their tracks and demanded that the weapon be returned, but the Innugaakalikurit refused. Enraged, the giants destroyed an entire village of the arctic dwarves.\n\nThe elders of Gronne soon arrived to negotiate a settlement, as they hoped to prevent an all out war from breaking out. The elders eventually found the dwarves guilty of theft, and awarded custody of those who participated in the disassembling to the Frost giants. The giants promptly enslaved their new captives, and their descendants have remained enslaved until present times.\n\nAs of the late 15th century DR, the glacial ice around the Novularond had begun to thaw.",

The portal survived, but ended up buried deep within the glacier, and was slowly carried into parts unknown as the glacier moved.\n\nAmong the Ulutiuns of the Great Glacier, there were a number of theories to explain why the rocks of Novularond radiated warmth, including that there was liquid fire under the region, or that fire breathing monsters lurked in the depths of the mountain tunnels. They declined to live in the area, but visited for occasional hunting expeditions. The unnatural warmth actually was a byproduct of the magics surrounding the necklace of Ulutiu: in the lowest depths under Novularond, a passage coursed eastwards until reaching the resting place of Ulutiu's ice barge, deep under the Lugalpgotak Sea. When the avatar of Ulutiu died, this passage became a magical conduit used by the necklace to sustain the Great Glacier by transferring all the excess heat from the lands of the glacier into the mountains of Novularond, where it radiated out from the stone.",

                "paras": "Tsurlagol was almost as old as its sister-city Procampur, and shared a common origin, having also been founded by human settlers from fallen Jhaamdath (what is now Chondath). They settled on the southern coast of the Vast and, in the Year of Enchanted Hearts, \u221272 DR, founded the city of Chessagol, as it was then known.\n\nAccording to local legend, the first Tsurlagol was destroyed by uncontrollable powerful magic. This was the first of many times that the city would be destroyed.\n\nFrom then on, over the course of Tsurlagol's long history, the city was raided, sacked, burned, and destroyed numerous times, by pirates, conquerors, orcish and other hordes, magic, and various other forces. No conquerors held it for long. But each time and each generation, the people salvaged whatever survived and rebuilt the city. They relied on their trade to fund their reconstruction, and local dwarves received a steady income rebuilding Tsurlagol each time. In this way, the city was rebuilt at least twenty times.\n\nIn the early 5th century DR, King Meldath I of Impiltur led a conquest of the Vast and other nearby lands, turning Chessagol and Proeskampalar (Procampur) into vassal city-states. He took the royal regalia of both cities.[note 1]\n\nOnce, early in Tsurlagol's history, an unknown warrior rode before the walls, waving his banner and boasting. The city's defenders met the challenge and attacked; four of them brought down the nameless warrior and slew him. His treasure was discovered, and the city's acquisitive wizards took one particular gem, the Moaning Diamond artifact. The nameless warrior was cremated and his bones stored in one of Tsurlagol's ossuaries.\n\nAccording to mosaics found in the subterranean ruins of Tsurlagol, wizards once using fire magic started a blaze that got out of control and burned down the city again. So fierce was the inferno that a wizard in an azure cloak was forced to use the Moaning Diamond to cause a great earthquake to topple the walls and towers of Tsurlagol, burying the city itself beneath the earth to put the fire out. The wizard died in the earthquake and was treated with honors. Later tales in the Vast claimed that it was the gods who sent the earthquake in response to people's pleas.[note 2]\n\nIn the 7th century DR, Chessagol came under the rule of King Lamoth and his newly royal family, though they were not considered legitimate. Lamoth sought to bolster his line by marrying his children to the royal families of Cormyr, Milvarn, Westgate, and others around the Inner Sea. Finally, he successfully arranged a marriage between his daughter Elthia and Prince Bellodar III of Impiltur. Bellodar became king of Impiltur, and Elthia queen, in the Year of Sifting Sands, 642 DR.\n\nIn the mid\u201313th century DR, the Vast suffered rampaging hordes of orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, supplemented by some human brigands and half-breed rogues. In the summer of the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR, the orc warlord Fottergrim and the magelord Archlis led a mixed horde of them against Tsurlagol. It was thought that they bribed the gate guards to allow them access. The horde invaded the city and took over, while numerous local humanoids of their kinds flocked to join the city.[note 3]\n\nFortunately, the Thultyrl of Procampur chose to honor his city's treaty with Tsurlagol and led an army to besiege and free the city, with the aid of the Siegebreakers, an adventuring band of sappers. In their expedition, the Siegebreakers discovered the Moaning Diamond beneath Tsurlagol. By the siege's end, the southwest and western walls of Tsurlagol were destroyed, thanks partially to the Siegebreakers diverting a river beneath it and mostly to use Archlis using the Moaning Diamond to collapse them. Fottergrim and Archlis were slain, Procampur's armies victorious, and Tsurlagol was liberated. Fottergrim's silver-plated skull was mounted on a pillar halfway between the two cities with a warning against threatening Procampur's allies.",

In the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR, the king's treasury and armory were robbed\u2014by magic, some said.

Each Ven served for a 10-year term, in which their word was law, though unpopular Ven tended to die prematurely. Strangely, the true identity of the Ven was kept secret throughout their reign; it was an odd arrangement but apparently worked well for Tsurlagol.\n\nThe nominal second-in-power was the Ven's Voice, who served as a spokesperson for both the Ven and the Council. The Voice was also chief advisor to the Ven and announced the Ven's decrees to the people of Tsurlagol. As such, in many ways, the Voice could often be more powerful than the Ven themself. This position was not secret, and in the late 1360s DR, the Ven's Voice was the ambitious Conoptora Billon.\n\nPreviously, Tsurlagol was ruled by a monarchy. King Lamoth ruled in the 7th century DR. He had a fledgling rule, and his large royal family was not considered legitimate. Law and order was enforced by the Royal Constabulary. Even as late as 1351 DR, the city was led by King Osbrun.

The cult was organized into semi-autonomous cells, each led by one or more \"Wearers of Purple\".\n\nIt was during this leaderless period that a cultist named Severin Silrajin came to prominence. Guided by Tiamat, he decided that the Chronicles of Years to Come had been mistranslated by Sammaster, and predicted that the world would be ruled not by dead dragons, but by living ones. He quickly rose through the cult's ranks until he became its leader, at which point he refocused the cult's efforts to summoning Tiamat into Faer\u00fbn.

After they recovered the tome, the gargoyles flew east across mountains and deserts towards the home of Asmiak. When they passed over the High Forest, they soared to rest and were shot down by a volley of silver arrows. The book however was not recovered by the elven archers and would wind up in the stewardship of another mage.\n\nThe Book of the Silver Talon was next known to be in the hands of the magician Phandal, after finding it in a bazaar. He in turn traded it to the thaumaturgist Alphon, who wound up fleeing from numerous goblin raids upon his home. Next in possession was the druid Rairun \"Blackbrow\", who shipped it in a caravan to a colleague, only to learn of that caravan vanishing in the moorlands. It was next found by the adventurer Shoon, who brought it with him to Waterdeep. Shoon traded it to the merchant Deragus, who lost it when his shop was robbed by the master thief Dunas. Its next owner or owners were unknown and as of 1359 DR the spellbook was still unaccounted for.",

Interspersed among the suth were tall shadowtops and slightly shorter pine trees, all towering over a thick underbrush made of ivy, climbing vines, and brambles like living, leafy spider webs clawing their way upward.\n\nThe canopy and clinging vines blocked most of the sunlight from reaching the ground, creating a green gloom in the understory. The floor of the forest was typically covered with dead leaves to a depth of at least a foot (thirty centimeters) that decomposed in the damp dark to form rich but smelly black soil.\n\nWhile many of the vines that clung to the canopy were innocuous, the Forest of Amtar was riddled with choke creepers and had large populations of assassin vines and ropers as well. The constant heat and humidity made it a perfect habitat for crawling and flying insects, including giant beetles such as the giant rhinoceros beetle. Many species of snakes and lizards were at home in the Amtar, including giant varieties.\n\nMany jungle mammals could also be found within the forest: jaguars, leopards, and tigers prowled the underbrush; wild boar were fairly common; monkeys, gorillas, and carnivorous apes made their home generally in the northern half of the forest, but packs of dire apes and girallons could be found wandering the entire Amtar. Tropical birds were also well represented in the Amtar, including parrots and macaws.\n\nWildlife was so abundant in the Forest of Amtar that Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale, speculated that the forest contained active portals that allowed creatures to wander in from other places and/or several deepspawn with a nearly endless food supply.",

In the mid-to-late 1360s DR, these included a group of outcast Arkaiuns, a band of orcs led by an ogre mage named Tandi Earsgone, and an evil adventuring company known as Dracil's Raiders. By the early 1370s, the orc band and Dracil's group had been eliminated or scattered and newer groups, such as the all-female Raunstrar and  magi-centric Maurvurr had moved in. A ragtag group of humans, half-orcs, and ogres plagued the road between Channathgate and the Landrise. This group may have reformed under Tandi Earsgone because the leader was an ogre mage calling himself Tandith Tornears.[speculation]\n\nSome of the giant snakes in the Forest of Amtar (and elsewhere) were blessed by the god of serpents, Sseth, and these cunning and intelligent beings were known as elder serpents. In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR, the rival god Set attacked Sseth, bound him, and took over his portfolio and the worship of his elder serpents.\n\nAt some point in time a group of chokers from the Underdark somehow made its way to the Amtar Forest and acclimatized to live in the heat and the gloom.\n\nAs of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, an adult male mercury dragon named Trinculo made his home here.",

When he arrived to the New Amnian fortress port of Helmsport they purchased a nearby plantation and its native workforce from Jalimar Trollslayer, one of the original soldiers of the Golden Legion, who left to find the fabled City of Gold. He was capable in managing the plantation, raising tobacco and indigo. Eventually he too desired to find the fabled City of Gold, but cared too much for his own life to go on adventure like Jalimar, who went missing in his attempt. In Drakosa's mind the eager, loyal, and expendable adventurers of Faer\u00fbn existed for this purpose.\n\nIn 1362 DR, he hired an adventuring party to find the Cloak of One Plume in order to give it to Governor Cordell to gain his favor. They weren't a particularly experienced group, as Drakosa believed more experienced adventurers were less likely to follow orders and more likely to be missed if they disappeared. He also sent his two servants, Hasoctl and Ironspike, with the adventurers to check up on them.\n\nAt the end of 1368 DR, prior to returning to Maztica from Calimshan he purchased five jhasina based on their beauty, among them an agent of the Twisted Rune named Tara. He viewed the women as a potential status symbol, for not even the Governor of New Amn had a harem themselves, and thus by extension a political tool for furthering his goals of becoming a governor himself.\n\nIn later years, Drakosa managed to purchase most of the Payit lands, becoming the largest landholder of the New Amnian colonies. Then in late 1369 DR, he hired a small group of Legionnaires with Cordell's permission and traveled up river past the city of Qoral, establishing a new plantation colony by the name of Drakmul. Within eight months Drakosa's colony proved to be very prosperous and he planned to establish a trail to the village of Patil.",

He negotiated a deal to allow an adventuring company called the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose to open an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise within the ruin, and efforts to rebuild the manor began. A few months later, a group known as The Six sent a party of mercenaries led by the necromancer Hoobur Gran'Shoop to attack the manor.

Lhaeo had no desire to rule as king and at first refused to listen to Khelben, but after being shown a collection of royal regalia and speaking with Sylun\u00e9, he at last agreed to take on the responsibility.\n\nA fake \"Lhaeo\" illusion was created by Elminster, and Haedrak began his quest. For several months, he trained with Storm Silverhand in swordcraft and continued to develop his arcane talents.\n\nHe first traveled to Voonlar, where he met the exiled wizardess Perendra Raslemtar. The two traveled to Silverymoon, where they worked out a plan with Alustriel and Khelben to assist Zaranda in taking back Tethyr.\n\nBy autumn of that year, Haedrak arrived in Waterdeep, where he was recognized officially as Prince Haedrak by Lord Piergeiron and built up a large number of allies and gathered an army. He sailed to Zazesspur and assisted in retaking the city for Zaranda Star. It was learned that she herself was a prisoner in Myratma, however, so Haedrak set out to rescue her.\n\nShe was eventually rescued from Shoonach by Haedrak with the help of his platinum-scaled pseudodragon familiar, Purlakhonthiis, and the centaur Timoth Eyesbright. They returned with haste to Myratma to assist in the siege there.\n\nThe siege and the war ended at the beginning of the next year, the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR. The war ended with a final duel between Prince Haedrak and Prince Yusuf Jhannivvar, the Pretender.

While it an historical site of and importance to Amarandaris' superiors, it also served as a place where they could conduct their slave trade, beyond the trappings of free and civilized society.\n\nBeginning in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR, unusual conflicts arose between the goblin tribes of Dekanter that followed the being known as the Beast Lord. Within four years, all-out war broke out and refugees began pouring into Parnast. Amarandaris himself went into the goblin settlement and spoke with their leader Ghistpok, who offered groveling assurances that all was well. When a Zhent garrison within the mines was destroyed and a caravan bound for Yarthrain went missing, Amarandaris returned to the mines for revenge. After Ghistpok blamed the assaults on Red Wizards and their undead thralls, Amarandaris offered weapons to the Beast Lord's goblins so they could defend themselves.\n\nWhile the guilty Red Wizards were caught by Amarandaris' men the following year, the Zhent garrison was leveled one again. According to the leader Ghistpok, the belligerent soldiers had been deformed by the Beast Lord into deformed, monstrous beings.\n\nAfter another year went by, Amarandaris ordered the southern branch of the Dawn Pass Trail to be rerouted away from Dekanter, to avoid losing more men the increasingly-powerful Beast Lord. The trail was moved about 1.7\u202fmi  (2.7\u202fkm) to the east, away from the perilous mountains nearer the Lonely Moor. The Zhentarim slave trade in the region was put to an end, and goblin refugees continued to plague Amarandaris and Parnast well into the following year.\n\nIn order to bring some good fortune to the Black Network during a period of great strife, Amarandaris took action to manipulate the mage Druhallen whom he knew planned on delving into the Netherese ruins. specifically a powerful artifact he believed could be found within. Amarandaris offered protection and transportation to Druhallen and his companions in exchange for useful information to offer Sememmon and his other superiors. While Druhallen originally refused, Amarandaris tried another tack and coerced Druhallen's young companion Tiep, to track the party's movements through Dekanter alone and report back everything he witnessed along the way, and recover a small iron box from the ruined Zhent garrison.\n\nWhen Druhallen, Tiep and their other companions left Weathercote Wood they were escorted by a dozen of Amarandaris' men back to Parnast. After sharing dinner in the lord's quarters, Druhallen offered Amarandaris a unique gift: a rubbing on a linen shirt of the Arcanus Fundare Tiersus, the first part of one of the fifty lost Nether Scrolls. In exchange, Druhallen requested that he and his lord Sememmon cease all contact with young Tiep and allow him to live his life free from Zhentarim influence. Amarandaris readily agreed, unaware the linen rubbing held none of the arcane power imbued within the original scroll.",

During the battles, the king himself vanquished the red wyrm Rithaerosurffel.\n\nAround \u22122200\u00a0DR Baphomet-worshiping cultists of Ammarindar created the Labyrinth, which was later abandoned and taken over by baphitaurs.\n\nThe year \u2212897\u00a0DR saw the defeat and death of the legendary hero-king Olaurin at the claws of the deep dragon Erthungaron.\n\nWith growing concern about the increasingly hostile Netherese wizards, King Azkuldar III established the arcane college of Xothol in \u2212550\u00a0DR. It would serve as an arcane workshop of sorts for the spellcasters of Ammarindar for almost 300 years.\n\nIn the same year as the founding of the Standing Stone, in 1 DR, the Ammarindar dwarves completed construction on the city of Citadel Yaunoroth, intended to defend their southern reaches from the increasingly aggressive orcs of the North. Although they stood strong, and sacrificed their lives against the ravages of the surface-dwelling orcs, the kingdom fell in 882 DR. When the demons of Ascalhorn ravaged the North and set upon Yaunoroth, Queen Helmma and her sister Princess Olmma sacrificed themselves in defense of the dwarfhold, allowing many of their people to flee south to Oghrann.\n\nThe kingdom was abandoned so quickly that a great wealth of gems, treasure, and the finest weapons and armor were left scattered through its cities and subterranean network of tunnels. This abundance of riches would bandits and human scavengers for years to come, especially from the town of Loudwater. The adventuring companies of the Black Band, the Company of the Horse and the Company of the Scaled Tail all met their end in their search for the riches of the dwarven kingdom.\n\nThe tanarukk Scoured Legion, led by the cambion Kaanyr Vhok of Hellgate Keep stripped the capital of Splendarrmornn of all its riches in 1220 DR, arming themselves with the looted suits of adamantine armor, and established a city that came to known as Ammarindar the continued into the 15th century DR.",

Able was part of the rescue team assembled by Khelben Arunsun to travel through Undermountain to reach the only portal to the Utter East that was in the vicinity of the city. Blackstaff was unable to teleport the paladins to the portal directly because of Kern's anti-magical abilities, leaving the party with only one choice\u2014traveling through Skullport.\n\nWhen the paladins reached Skullport, the group was tasked with aiding zombies by the mysterious Skulls of Skullport in penance for destroying one of the watchers. The group split apart in search of undead to aid. Able felt fear of the undead caused by his past failures to turn them with the power of Tyr; he sweated profusely, his breath was caught in short heaves and gasps. Even so, he had to perform the task. Able found himself in a city filled with the undead and, upon noticing a zombie that used to be a teenager, the cleric lost the last of his composure. He tried to destroy the walking corpse with his turn undead ability, and it failed. Instead, Able took his warhammer to the undead and disposed of the body. The cleric felt that he aided the zombie by releasing its spirit.\n\nAfter the paladins passed out of Skullport, they encountered a group of ettins. An unfortunate skirmish let to the death of Harloon, for whom Able delivered a prayer before the rescue team had to move on.\n\nCloser to the destination, the paladins came across tanar'ri aiming to use the same portal as the heroes. Barlguras were using a magical mirror located not far from the portal to create duplicates of themselves. Another battle broke out. Able felt the terror of not being able to access his god's divine powers to save his comrades. Thankfully, at the last moment, Tyr granted the cleric the power to stop the advancing tanar'ri.

He made secret deals with leaders in the Moonsea to erect temples to Iyachtu Xvim, Bane's divine son, within the capitals of their city-states. His aim to extend the will of the Lord of Tyrants across Toril was a dynamic factor behind many of the changes within the organization. He sought to use the Black Network to set the stage for the return of the Lord of Tyrants.[citation\u00a0needed]\n\nBy the late 15th century the goals of the Zhentarim came in line with their original ideals, despite their more benign public perception. By offering the best guards and mercenaries, with the final aim of an iron-fisted monopoly on protection services in the Realms, they sought to make the merchants of Faer\u00fbn, and thus the continental economy, completely reliant upon them as an organization.

They were not above resorting to sabotage, blackmail, arson to outright murder to undermine their mercantile or political opponents.

He called for a garrison to be established at the Citadel of the Raven to protect the greater Moonsea from a horde of orcs that was stirring further north.

Humans waged costly battles against the orcs of the mountains to control the pass, but were ultimately successful. The effort saved the last of the dwarves of Roldilar from being wiped out by the orcs at the fall of that kingdom. In one seemingly impossible battle, allied forces of men and elves led by Arngor of the Oak fought against a horde of orcs within Three Trees Pass. Legend told that Arngor battled the commander of the orc army in single combat until the sun set and the land was shrouded in a bloody mist. Arngor defeated the orc commander but was mortally wounded himself, beyond the saving of any cleric or healer. His blood soaked into his plate armor, imbuing it with his noble courage and making it famous as the armor of the hart.\n\nConflicts continued to be fought through the pass as human prospectors moved into the surrounding mountains and clashed with the orcs.",

Once a month, prior to the goddess's disappearance in 1358 DR, a priest of Waukeen passed through to dispense healing for exorbitant prices.\n\nDue to the frequent orc attacks, no one lived in Three Trees Pass, nor built permanent structures.",

He eventually returned to his home city, and in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR he founded the Flaming Fist mercenary company, unifying several smaller mercenary groups in the process. The Fist quickly became popular, drawing so many recruits that it numbered two thousand strong not long after its foundation. With his newfound political power, Eltan leveraged his way onto the city's ruling Council of Four. One of his first acts was to hire his own company to to establish law and order in the crime-ridden Lower City of Baldur's Gate, using government taxes to finance the enterprise. Incorporating Eltan and the Flaming Fist into the ruling structure of Baldur's Gate was a large benefit to the city, through increasing tax revenue, curbing lawlessness, and making it a significant military power along the Sword Coast.\n\nIn the early 1360s DR, Eltan and the Flaming Fist were involved in several ventures. They were hired by Sembia to fight the Tuigan menace in the Hordelands, and aided the Golden Legion of Amn in ending the notorious pirate lord Akbet-Khrul. Eltan also hired his company out for reduced rates in Tethyr: it was speculated he was planning to leverage this into setting up a puppet government for himself.\n\nWhen Maztica was discovered in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR, Eltan immediately financed expeditions to the new continent, as well as to Chult. He was inspired by his city's founder, Balduran, who had vanished whilst searching for Anchorome. Seized by an urge to explore, Eltan purchased a fleet of ships and sent hundreds of Flaming Fist across the sea, led by his friend Scar. The Maztica expedition arrived in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR, and founded the settlement of Fort Flame on Maztican soil. Fort Flame was heavily beset by sahuagin and wild elves, but remained standing. Scar returned to Baldur's Gate, and in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR reinforcements sent by Eltan arrived at Fort Flame.\n\nWhen the iron crisis plagued the Sword Coast a couple years later, Duke Eltan worked with Scar and Abdel Adrian to investigate the Iron Throne and their activities within the city. Unfortunately, a greater doppelganger took the place of Eltan's healer Rashad and gradually poisoned the Grand Duke over a period of time. While the untrustworthy Angelo Dosan briefly took power as the head of the Flaming Fist, Eltan was able to recover from his ailment.\n\nIn Uktar of that year, Eltan and his fellow dukes committed one hundred Flaming Fist mercenaries to the Coalition army. The combined forces marched on Dragonspear Castle to stop the senseless destruction caused by the Shining Crusade.",

Tyche, goddess of luck, had been corrupted by a form of the god Moander, and in order to save her, her dear friend Sel\u00fbne (warned by Lathander, Azuth, and divinations from the Pale Tesseract) struck her with a bolt of pure light that split her husk apart, allowing Tymora and Beshaba to emerge. The Lady of Silver wept for Tyche, however, and one tear that fell from her divine countenance came to the Material Plane in the form of a meteorite, where it was found by her followers in Thar.\n\nOne shard of the Tear was placed upon an oaken staff, which the priestesses used to guide them northward to safety in the land of Vaasa. There they built a shrine to guard and venerate the Tear, using magical steel keys (fashioned from the fragments of space iron that had fallen to earth along with the gemstone) to lock the shrine and thus keep the artifact from falling into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, when one key was sent to a temple farther south for safekeeping, it was lost in a bandit attack. Not long after, a tribe of ogres that had witnessed both the meteorite's fall and the Sel\u00fbnites' journey northward tracked them down and, in a raid, captured the northern key. For centuries after it would remain in their cave hideout, eventually falling under the control of a behir. The staff of the Shard, in the meantime, remained with the priestesses who kept vigil over the Tear until eventually being lost in the Marsh of Chelimber. It was later recovered and held in trust for the Moonmaiden by Fuorn, the treant master of the Forgotten Forest.\n\nNot until sometime during the 12th century by Dalereckoning did the southern key turn up again, this time in the possession of a Red Wizard of Thay by the name of Crossar. Although never proven for certain, his sudden rise to fame and great political power among his rivals was attributed by the Simbul to divine aid that he had drawn from the Tear via the lost key. Thanks to only possessing one, however, he eventually fell afoul of the artifact's curse\u2014losing all his influence and magic, his tower in the Umber Swamp lost to mortal knowledge and buried beneath the destructive battlefield created when he split into a watchghost and a crimson death.\n\nAn adventuring company known only as the Seekers was finally sent by Sel\u00fbne herself in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR to recover the Tear and the talismans needed to find and safely use it. After receiving the staff of the Shard, a long journey to Crossar's tomb with the Simbul's assistance, and a battle with the behir that guarded the northern key, the company finally arrived in the Shine of the Tear, only to be captured along with the artifact by the Zhentarim. The Tear was lost to history, although it was almost certainly present in Zhentil Keep when that city was destroyed by the insanity of Cyric in 1368 DR.[note 1] What happened to the staff, the keys, and the Seekers was also unknown, although a fragment of their journal did eventually wash up in a fisherman's net near Elmwood.",

Later, he promoted a knight, Thindhul, to the position of Commander in preparation for a ride through the Underdungeon of Stardeep.\n\nDuring the ride across the Underdungeon, the Knights discovered a buried city ruin; there, they came into contact with the relic lich, which sent out revived fossils after them. While fighting, they were found and joined by Kiril, who was also looking for them. Kiril helped break the stalemate between the lich and Telarian, who had joined the company in their ride.\n While they returned to Stardeep, the thief Gage began to follow them too.

The mistress of the castle, Lady Exeltis, died under mysterious circumstances many years later, leaving the family business and Castle Exeltis to her only heir\u2014the ambitious young lord Feldran.\n\nIn reality, Feldran Exeltis was the reason for the castle's decline, and the death of his mother. Some of the hushed bard songs along the Sword Coast told the tale of the young lord accompanying his old mother on her late night walks along the cliffs and plunging the Exeltis Blade in her back, later claiming the Lady fell to her death. Her gravestone was erected at the bottom of the cliffs where she allegedly met her doom.\n\nBy 1372 DR, Castle Exeltis was in disrepair and the family fortune was squandered away on lavish purchases and senseless gambling by Feldran Exeltis. His managing of the family resources led to an almost complete halt of Exeltis Ice Wine production, making the bottles that were still out there a precious rarity. The financial situation became so dreary that Feldran took several sizable loans from dubious moneylenders from Waterdeep.",

That adventure novel told the story of Captain Samuel Turgat and his sidekick Doctor Algernon. Enamored with dreams of adventures on the high sea, \"Samuel\" purchased a boat he called Flyingfish unsung his sizable inheritance and legally changed his name to that of the fictional pirate. He hired a crew of \"scurvy scallywags\" and set to build his new life.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Captain Turgat was fired to dock in Daggerford after his ship suffered some damage in a fierce gale. The captain let his crew get drunk on their shore leave as he supervised the repairs. When Samuel Turgat met the Hero of Daggerford, he welcomed the opportunity to speak without the pirate jargon that tired him out. He informed the adventurer about a suspicious frigate docked text to the Flyingfish, the Barracuda. The ship has exclusively been loaded up under cover of darkness from suspicious barges that traveled up the Delimbiyr River.",

Comparatively to other armor types, brigandine was heavier but more flexible than hide armor while being stiffer but lighter than scale mail.\n\nSome makeshift brigandines were crafted by pirates and brigands out of ship sails, canvas sacks, coins, and brass splitters.

One was a claw attack called Eagle Talon.\n\nIt had a philosophy of strict personal discipline and lawful behavior, married with physical training in order to attain harmony of the soul and complete control of the body and very being. Danica considered that while elves might have the physical grace and control necessary, they might lack the focused discipline required. It required meditative practices, martial arts training, concentration techniques, and channeling the hidden powers of the body. Those who studied it often dedicated themselves to it completely. However, the tests and training could be deadly.\n\nOne extreme test of discipline was called Iron Skull, or Gigel Nugel, a maneuver that allowed one to break through stone using just their head. The test was involved, taking many minutes of concentration and clearing the mind of distractions, chanting and motions to harmonize body and spirit, and mentally challenging the stone itself to convince the practitioner they would succeed.\n\nThe practitioner developed keen senses and with concentration and meditation, they could notice unseen and invisible beings and identify traps. By entering a meditative trance, they could even see things as they truly were, though this took four hours to achieve and lasted for only two.\n\nAlso through meditation, they could control their bodily functions, to limit injury and slow bleeding, and in effect partly heal their wounds. The pinnacle technique was the ability to enter a state of physical suspension, slowing or even stopping breathing and the beating of the heart to such a degree they appeared to be dead to almost all observers. This state could be maintained for up to eight hours. Danica expanded on this, adapting the technique for coming out of suspension to restart a stopped heart in another by striking the chest.\n\nPenpahg's scrolls were labelled with pictograms: crossed fists signified a combat technique, an open eye signified a concentration technique.",

The Edificant Library in Erlkazar had acquired a collection by the mid\u201314th century DR. However, he and his practice remained barely known in western Faer\u00fbn.\n\nIn the 1350s DR, Master Turkel Bastan, a Tabotan monk and follower of the long-dead grandmaster who had settled in Westgate, taught the martial art to his apprentice, Danica Maupoissant. Circa 1360 DR, having taught her all he could, he bade her travel to the Edificant Library to learn directly from the scrolls kept there.\n\nFrom then on, Danica dedicated herself to mastering Penpahg's techniques and philosophies. However, she had some difficulty deciphering the old texts and consulted with her lover, Cadderly Bonaduce. When the Chaos Curse afflicted the Edificant Library in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR, Danica became obsessed with attempting the dangerous Iron Skull test on a very large block of stone, in order to be a true disciple of Grandmaster Penpahg D'Ahn. Cadderly stalled her, by convincing her to wait so the event could be properly documented for future students, though she later attempted it alone, repeatedly, and injured herself. She ultimately countered the curse with her meditation and concentration techniques and later resuscitated Pikel Bouldershoulder by adapting Penpahg's technique. Five weeks later, fully recovered, she attempted it again, in the proper frame of mine and before an audience. She successfully broke the stone and, when she awoke, achieved the highest rank of the disciples of Penpahg D'Ahn. The following year, Danica entered a state of physical suspension to avoid the gaze of the vampire Kierkan Rufo.",

For example, several small native tribes (those unrelated to the Issacortae, Pazruki, Wu-haltai, or others, and not more recent immigrants) of primitive ways who still wielded stone and bronze, not iron, were theorized to be descendants of the Ancient Lords. They figured in many local legends. Most humans thought they no longer existed.\n\nHowever, the Maraloi lived on in secret, dwelling in \"the great northern wood\"[note 1] This was a secret known only to a few outsiders, but included the Emperor of Shou Lung (Kai Tsao Shou Chin around 1359 DR), who imparted it to trusted agents, such as a hu hsien assassin.\n\nBayalun was half-Maraloi, being the daughter of a Maraloi woman and a human man.[note 2] She grew up among them but married into the Tuigan people and became prominent as Second Empress Eke Bayalun Khadun beside Yamun Khahan of the Grand Army of the Tuigan.

The fomorians, however, abandoned the field, allowing Eusebius to flank the firbolgs and assist his paramount. Anastes was struck in the stomach by the axe of Raeyadfourne, the leader of the firbolgs, but then Anastes slew him in a single swing of his massive sword.

It began to create new monstrosities, Dekanter goblins merged with the awakened mantises from the nearby Weathercote Wood. Within six years, the situation grew beyond the control of the Zhent Lord Amarandaris of Parnast, and he was forced to reroute the trail leading past the mines and pull Zhentarim forces away from the region.\n\nGrowing concerned about the Beast Lord's increasing power while in possession of the Nether Scroll the otherworldly being known as Lady Wyndyfarh, dispatched a lost goblin from the mines named Sheemzher to enlist the aid of good folks from the nearby towns. Sheemzher joined with the honest mage named Druhallen, his bodyguard companion Rozt'a, and her foster son Tiep to steal the Nether Scroll away from the Beast Lord. The Beast Lord's powerful magic proved too much for the meager travelers, but an assault by mind flayers from Llacerelly was opportunity enough for the surface-dwellers to recover the scroll and flee from Dekanter.\n\nThe ancient alhoon survived the assault, and remained within Dekanter for a number of years. By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, the Beast Lord was continuing his search for ancient Netherese treasure along with his hordes of Dekanter goblins, many of which had spread far and wide in the Greypeak Mountains beyond his lair.

Some described it as being sucked into the void with no chance of resistance or recovery, even by a wish or similar magics. However, the sphere was considered a minor artifact by some and this was evidenced by the immunity that other artifacts seemed to have against being drawn into the void. There were also reports of beings who survived coming in contact with a sphere, but they suffered grievous wounds as if struck by a tremendous force. And finally, divine intervention was a possible path to restoration from annihilation, but getting the attention of a deity to ask a boon was generally fraught with risk.\n\nThe sphere was partially responsive to mental commands of movement, with beings of higher intelligence having a better chance of success. The black hole always moved when someone attempted to control it, but not always in the desired direction. A failure was typically indicated by the sphere moving toward the creature that was making the attempt. If two or more people attempted to control the sphere simultaneously, even cooperatively, the chance for success was reduced for all, or it became a contest between the would-be controllers that was largely determined by intelligence and luck.\n\nThere was no evidence that a sphere of annihilation had intelligence or awareness, but some adventurers reported that one attacked them when they got too close.\n\nThe chances of controlling a sphere of annihilation were greatly improved when in possession of a talisman of the sphere.\n\nThe sphere also reacted strangely when it came in contact with portals, gate spells, and other inter-dimensional phenomenon like portable holes. There was a random chance that nothing would happen, the sphere was transported to the destination of the other phenomenon, or every creature and object within 180\u202fft  (55\u202fm) was whisked off to a random plane of existence. The most likely outcome was that the sphere was simply destroyed, but it was a toss up between that and the other possibilities.

                "paras": "Aldanon was a wealthy, yet absent-minded, sage living in Neverwinter. Originally, he built his manse on the outskirts, away from the main thoroughfare, but the reconstruction following the war with Luskan in 1372 DR resulted in his home being in the middle of the new Blacklake district. As such, he began placing wards in order to keep out opportunistic nobles hoping to buy his estate, as well as the murderer on the loose in 1374 DR.\n\nAldanon had came into the possession of one of the silver shards from the Sword of Gith, though he had long since forgotten who sold it to him. He knew Ammon Jerro from long ago, when he was a court wizard at Castle Never, and knew that Jerro had once possessed a githyanki silver sword (though not that it was Gith's own blade).\n\nWhen the Kalach-Cha and companions arrived in Neverwinter with a shard, they had Sand examine both that and Duncan's shard, detecting the two had far more power than before. Determining this was beyond his skill, Sand suggested the Kalach-Cha take it to Aldanon for a more professional analysis. Unfortunately, the murders of Dalren and other noblemen led to the Blacklake district being quarantined, forcing the Kalach-Cha to work through the City Watch or Shadow Thieves to get access. After obtaining access, the Kalach-Cha was able to visit Aldanon in his manse. The sage was interested in the two shards, allowing him to compare them to the one he had. After a quick test, he finally determined they were pieces of a githyanki silver sword.\n\nAldanon knew about the githyanki Sword Stalkers, and that they searched for missing silver swords. He believed that was why they were seeking out the Kalach-Cha and the shards. He knew that Ammon Jerro was more knowledgeable on the subject, but was told he had died long ago, and any research of his would likely be kept in his Haven. He recommended the Kalach-Cha visit the Neverwinter Archives and try to find any information on Jerro, or his family, that could lead to the Haven.\n\nLater, he learned that Lord Tavorick had possession of another silver shard that had been passed around by nobles, and believed that might have been what the Blacklake murderer was trying to find. He sent a message to the Sunken Flagon, but by the time the Kalach-Cha arrived, the house had been taken over by several thugs and Aldanon was missing. Aldanon found himself in Crossroad Keep as a prisoner, and learned from fellow prisoner Zhjaeve that Black Garius had abducted him because of difficulties in deciphering the Tome of Iltkazar. Aldanon remained relatively oblivious of the situation, and became entrenched in the many tomes stored at the keep. Among the rare books Garius and the Arcane Brotherhood had at the keep was a copy of the Tome of Vile Darkness, which Aldanon later noted.\n\nThe Kalach-Cha met him again in the (ruined) library after sneaking in through the escape tunnel. Aldanon was still oblivious to Garius's activities, and was far more interested in reading the tomes. The Kalach-Cha commanded him to flee to Neverwinter and warn the city of the possible danger, but not before Aldanon commented that if they started their \"dark rituals\" the best way to stop them was to make a lot of noise. As the Kalach-Cha stormed the ritual chamber, they lost focus and Garius and his ritualists were destroyed in the shadow backlash. The Greycloaks rescued Zhjaeve from her cell and Lord Nasher granted the keep's control over to the Kalach-Cha.\n\nBack in Neverwinter, at Captain Brelaina's office, Aldanon (confusingly) tried to explain who and what Zhjaeve was to the captain. Brelaina gave up and instead suggested the Kalach-Cha handle it, as the prisoner had specifically requested the Kalach-Cha himself/herself. Aldanon however was anxious to return to the keep and examine the contents of the library there. Once the library was fully refurbished by the Kalach-Cha or Nasher Alagondar, he relocated there for the remainder of the struggle.\n\nAldanon suspected the shadow tide emerging from the Mere of Dead Men was just an outline, and only strongest at its outer edge. He theorized they could safely strike at the King of Shadows if they could somehow teleport past the shadow barrier and into the heart of Merdelain.

These had been carved by seasonal rains which also deposited great banks of sand. The area was mostly rocky and covered with brush (such as hardy plants like cacti, grasses, and yucca). Rivers and streams flowed through the canyons and gullies, overflowing in flash floods each spring, and wild animals such as coyotes, antelope, bison, and lizards thrived.\n\nThe mountains surrounding the basin had much more rainfall, and their slopes were covered in \nconiferous forests (trees such as pine, fir, aspen, and spruce), and were home to such animals as deer, bears, and foxes. Higher in the mountains, above the treeline, the air was much colder and the landscape was perpetually covered in snow. Only yeti and some aarakocra could live here.\n\nThe salt flats were areas of the desert where bodies of saltwater had long since evaporated, leaving only the crystalline salt deposits behind. Animals could be found on the edges of a salt flat, but neither plants nor animals lived within (an Earth elemental could occasionally be found, though).",

Across the front of the inn was a covered porch with a railing for hitching horses. Above the porch was a balcony attached to the owner's apartments. The railing of this balcony had been turned into a makeshift herb garden by adding troughs of dirt along its length. The two-story inn extended quite far eastward, forming a long rectangle. The upper-floor rooms each had a window or a balcony. All the rooms on the south side had balconies facing the forest, which was only a few strides away.\n\nOn the north side of the building was a stableyard with several small barns for housing wagons and beasts, some granaries, and a cookhouse. All the outbuildings were constructed of mortared stone with slate roofs. The areas with high traffic were mostly clear, but the rest of the compound was covered in light underbrush haphazardly scoured by the owner's small pet pigs. Near the eastern end of the north face was a doorway that opened into the back hallway of the inn.\n\nFarthest from the road, just past the cookhouse, was an outbuilding that held marination vats used to tenderize and flavor the meat used in stew. These vats were kept covered and padlocked to prevent people from falling in (with or without their wrists and ankles bound) as was known to happen from time to time.",

The front stairs climbed north over the bar below. On the second floor, the hallway was offset to the north, making the rooms on the north side a few paces smaller than the south-facing rooms. The upper rooms were long and narrow and used a curtain to separate the bed and jakes from the closet and sitting area. The ground-floor rooms were more squarish. In addition to a closet and private jakes, rooms contained at least one bed, a chair, a table, a cot or couch, and a mirror mounted on the wall.",

For the length of their stay, guests were issued a baton with a permanent faerie fire cast on the tip, which they could use to illuminate their way around the inn. These lighted wands gave off as much light as a single candle and came in various colors.\n\nThe furniture throughout the building was old and represented a hodgepodge of styles obviously salvaged from other places. The walls were paneled with a dark wood, and more creaks were discovered in the floorboards with each passing year. The main common room had a ceiling the same height as the rest of the first floor and was populated with sturdy round tables of various sizes and many chairs but no benches. During the years the Wizard was owned by Harauna Beltzund, all drinking vessels were made of either wood or metal because she had a tendency to hurl things when angered.\n\nAt the opposite corner of the inn (southeast corner on the second floor) was the upper parlor, a room with an oversized balcony that faced the forest canopy and a reputation as a rendezvous for shady deals. When slavery was tolerated in this area, the upper parlor was one place this sordid business was conducted.\n\nHarauna had nothing against pets because she kept small pigs, but she disliked animals being brought into the inn. She grudgingly tolerated small pets and familiars, but anything that resembled a snake or was monstrously out of the ordinary was required to be locked up in the cellar of the farthest outbuilding, next to the marination vats, for the duration of the guest's stay.",

This price included all-you-cared-to-eat meals with a bottomless mug of beer. Stable prices were five silver pieces per animal per night. The rooms on the south side facing the forest were all at least two gold pieces, plus two silver pieces if it had a balcony. The upper story rooms were in the higher price range because they were quieter, not having creaky floorboards in a room above.\n\nChecking out of the Whistling Wizard required guests to return their candle-wands and settle the bill. A fee of 90 gold pieces was charged for a missing or broken baton. Guests could not retrieve their beasts and wagons from the stables unless they could show a paid bill sealed in the correct color of wax embossed with the owner's signet ring.\n\nStandard fare at the Wizard was soup, stew, bread with garlic butter, and fruit pies. On the warmest days of the year, the soup was leek and potato, served cold. Otherwise, it was a hot broth of boiled hoof, tongue, and tripes of oxen with diced vegetables. The stew had a heavy gravy and meat from snares set in the forest plus whatever old mutton, beef, or horse meat that had been marinating in the vats behind the cookhouse. All meats were fried before adding them to the stew. The bread and pies were baked locally.\n\nThe beer that came with the price of a room was called the Wizard's Quaff and was fairly weak, with a flavor that would charitably be called an acquired taste. The wine selection was limited and varied from season to season. In a good year, shipments of wine arrived from Sembia in late Uktar with dry, white wines from various locations around the Sea of Fallen Stars being the main selections. In a bad year, leftover dregs from dining establishments in Hillsfar arrived in early spring. Zzar was usually available because it was popular with guests from western lands. Drinks were served in the common room and the upper parlor or could be delivered to guest rooms. The prices varied from five coppers to five silver pieces for a (wooden) tallglass and from three to ten gold pieces for a bottle.\n\nThe kitchen staff did not take kindly to requests for special preparations or alterations in the menu. A guest poking his or her head into the cookhouse was likely to see the cooks and their assistants wearing minimal clothing and sweating over open hearths, smoky fires, baking ovens, and bubbling cauldrons, constantly shouting and sniping at each other. Unfamiliar faces were liable to be greeted with a hurled cleaver.",

The inn was also owned by at least one mage, named Casimur, who retired from wizard work to work at the Wizard, probably in the early 1350s DR.\n\nIn the mid-1350s, the owner of the Whistling Wizard was Ansilber Klauthaudra, when none other than Dove Silverhand was captured by Orvar \"The Unseen\", a Zhentarim operative, and was magically bound to servitude, ignominiously forced to work as a serving wench in the common room of the Wizard. Ansilber was a cruel and lazy taskmaster, but Dove bore his scorn and the degradation of her post in order to spy on the machinations of the neogis and stingers (manscorpions or tlincallis) that visited the inn while she was there. Her disguise was not good enough to fool her former pupil, Florin Falconhand, when he discovered her at the Wizard and released her from captivity, taking her to Shadowdale and eventually to Waterdeep, where they were wed. The eight-legged visitors stopped coming to the inn shortly after Dove left, leading a few senior Harpers to speculate that the creatures were there to keep an eye on her rather than the other way around.\n\nThe Wizard had many owners over the years, and the transition was not always peaceful. Late in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR, Ansilber Klauthaudra was found hacked to pieces in the common room. A Selgauntan ne'er-do-well by the name of Ravvas Thurrpurtyn bought the inn from Ansilber's estate and, according to Harper reports, was likely assassinated and impersonated by an agent of the Red Wizards of Thay, (who may have been replaced by a Malaugrym) possibly even before he set foot in Voonlar. \"Ravvas\" was later killed in a huge conflict (later dubbed the Battle at the Bar) that involved two uncoordinated Harper attacks, three members of the Knights of Myth Drannor, the Simbul, Storm Silverhand, an ogre mage, an illithid, doppelgangers, and three powerful mages from a Sembian kidnapping/slavery cabal known as the Tarntar.\n\nA tenday after the Battle at the Bar, the Bron (sheriff) of Voonlar and a contingent of Zhent elite escorted Anthalus Droon into the Whistling Wizard and backed up his claim that he was now the owner of the establishment. Droon proceeded to mismanage the inn, and it became evident during the cold season that Droon hated the weather, the town, and the inn but likely stayed because he was commanded to do so. Anthalus connived some investors into giving him money to improve the inn and attract a more reputable clientele, then disappeared with the funds. The largest creditor, Harauna Beltzund of Sembia, then assumed ownership of the Wizard.",

She thoroughly enjoyed the facade of being a bard. She often relied on her mind, sweet personality, and innocent cute looks to get her out of trouble that always seemed to find Olive. If those things fail, she hid under the table until the trouble blew over; hiding also was preferable because an unseen halfling was a living halfling. If she was forced to battle (or when her friends were in danger), she jumped into the combat with her blades out, with the ferocity of an angry wolverine.\n\nOlive was a talented storyteller and a liar. She oftentimes weaved long, convoluted stories to exhaust any possible line of questioning. She quickly turned fierce when someone treated her as a child, dared to question her bardic credentials, or had a gull to underpay the halfling.\n\nOlive was uncontrollable, impulsive, reckless, and often did not have the best foresight, the perfect combination of traits to constantly get into trouble.\n\nLike so many halflings, Olive loved food and drink and could easily outeat two adult males in one seating. Her friends learned to use food as the only good distraction to pacify the fiery bard. Olive's appetite was not the only insatiable desire she had. She loved learning stories, tales, songs, and limericks and appreciated learning new ones when she could.\n\nOlive often could not relate to depressed or simply sad people. She thought that if you had your health, full purse, were not love-struck, and ahead of the law, there was no reason to feel down. Olive remembered feeling that way about her aunt, who would cry after a single glass of wine, and Olive's mother explained that the crying did not come from the drink but the heart.\n\nAs a halfling who often faced prejudice, she could never tolerate bigotry. Even when, in some cases, they rightfully accused her of thievery. Olive herself thought paladins and clerics to be untrustworthy and stuck up, and humans to be brutes and warmongers.\n\nShe tried to avoid Hillsfar and its Red Plumes, also known as the Red Death, for what they did to the halfling population of the city.",

                "paras": "Olive's life forever changed when she was hired to perform at a Dimswart and Wyvernspur noble families' wedding in 1357 DR. She was traveling to Dimswart Manor with Akabar Bel Akash's trade caravan when an ancient red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco swooped down. Unfortunately for Olive, Mist appreciated entertainment as much as she did gold. The dragon kidnapped the bard and locked her in her Storm Horns lair. Before Olive was kidnapped, she \"borrowed\" Akabar's spellbook. This was when Olive met Alias, who was hired to rescue the bard in time for Gaylyn Dimswart's wedding. Alias was joined by her saurial companion Dragonbait and Akabar. Alias challenged the dragon to a Feint of Honor, an ancient honor-bound tradition. The swordswoman managed to avoid Mist's attacks and eventually, with the help of Olive's wit, won. Olive bluffed about having a ring fire of resistance and called Mist out on the dragon's attempt to roast the women despite Alias winning the Feint. As the red dragon was distracted retrieving the promised reward, Olive and Alias ran for their lives. Mist gave chase bur was sealed inside her lair when Akabar retrieved his spellbook from Olive, who \"secured\" it from the caravan.\n\nOlive was curious about Alias, her magic tattoos, and her mysterious past. Thinking the swordswoman could have been a long-lost rich princess definitely flared up halfling's greed. On their trip back to the wedding, the group was faced with a mineral quasi-elemental summoned by one of Alias' masters. The heroes survived the encounter and banished the creature back to its native plane. At the wedding, Olive got to perform a catchy ditty about the newlyweds when an unknown force took over Alias and made her attack a young nobleman Giogioni Wyvernspur. He survived the assassination attempt, thanks to Dragonbait's aid, but Alias herself fled.\n\nAkabar and Dragonbait followed her to Suzail, armed with the knowledge of Alias' masters. They were joined by Olive, who started mistrusting the woman after the assassination attempt but still owed her... and Olive's pockets were bulging with Dimswart Manor's loot, and she needed not to be there. The group caught up with Alias in the Hidden Lady inn in Suzail. There, the heroes told Alias about the meaning of the magic sigils on her arm. They stood for Cassana, Zrie Prakis, Fire Knives, Moander, and Phalse (unknown to them). Olive learned about Alias attacking a priest just a few days prior, only making the halfling even more suspicious. Alias decided to travel to Yulash to pursue the clue of the dead god of rot Moander.\n\nTraveling to the town of Yulash led the group to Shadow Gap, where they stopped to camp overnight at the ruins of the North Gate Inn. Olive and Akabar engaged in friendly teasing over cooking for the group, followed by the bard trying to use her talis deck to teach Dragonbait to communicate (the group did not know whether he was sentient), to the saurial's amusement. At night the group was ambushed by a kalmari, a monstrous extraplanar creature controlled by one of Alias' masters. Olive attempted to fight the creature using a broadsword found at the ruins, trying to protect her friends, but the sword was too big for a less-than-3-foot halfling. They managed to defeat the creature and reached Shadowdale the next day.\n\nIn Shadowdale, they stayed at the Old Skull Inn where Olive and Han played a duet to entertain the customers and heard Alias sing a beautiful song about the Standing Stone. The sellsword claimed it was a common song in the area, but no-one seemed to know it existed. Later that night, Olive came face to face with Phalse, who took the shape of a halfling and tempted her with precious platinum coins. Olive decided Alias was dangerous, being a human, and attacking two innocent people recently. She accepted the heaping amount of platinum and was tasked to carry a ring that was to allow Alias' masters to magically track her.\n\nOnce they reached Yulash, Alias and Dragonbait were lured to Moander's prison, and Akabar followed them, leaving sleeping Olive alone in the camp. This was where Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco caught up with the halfling. Thankfully, Dragonbait returned just in time to help the bard. Dragonbait was indeed an intelligent creature who could talk, and he challenged Mist to another Feint of Honor. Both Dragonbait and Oli dueled the angry dragon. Eventually, Olive showed her ingenuity once again. She used her ring of magic detection to cause Azure Bonds on the saurial's chest to explode in blinding pyrotechnics (tattoos' magical protection) giving Dragonobait an opportunity to attack it. Olive managed to throw a vial of peranox, a deadly poison, into Mist's maw. The duo won the Feint. Dragonbait used his divine magic to heal the downed dragons, and they enrolled the ancient lizard's help in fighting the newly released Abomination of Moander. Olive and Dragonbait rode the ancient red dragon to battle a god. Subsequently, they followed the Abomination through a gate to Westgate, where Mist engaged the god once again. Both the dragon and the Abomination of Moander perished in a blinding explosion. The heroes reunited once more, even though it was nothing but the calm before the storm.\n\nWhile Olive was happy to be reunited with Alias, she also felt conflicting emotions, feeling jealous of the \"perfect\" sellsword who seemingly could not do wrong, feeling underappreciated, and feeling mistrust of Dragonbait, realizing he was intelligent and a paladin to boot. Phalse approached Olive once again but to offer her a place by his side among Alias' masters. Led by her natural brashness, poor judgment, and negative emotions, the halfling bard decided to infiltrate the organization, get rich, and prove everyone her worth by spying on the villains.\n\nAlais, Akabar, and Dragonbait were overpowered and taken prisoners by Cassana. As a part of the Masters' Alliance, Olive witnessed the torture her friends were going through at the hands of Cassana and quickly realized how foolish and over her head she was. Phalse was planning on turning Olive into his plaything, Alias was about to be turned into a mindless weapon, Akabar was to be tortured and forced into Cassana's concubine, and Dragonbait killed off. Olive received an opportunity to rescue her friends when lich Zrie Prakis ordered Olive to assassinate Cassana, his ex-lover who enslaved his undead husk. Getting the freedom to move around the mansion, Olive discovered the prison where Akabar was held along with a seemingly insane rambling man. The insane man was the Nameless Bard, Finder Wyvernspur, and with his help, the halfling freed and healed Akabar, and together they took on the Alliance.\n\nThe heroes together destroyed Cassana and Zrie and subsequently were swept away to the Citadel of White Exile, an extraplanar citadel that served as Finder's prison that was turned into Phalse's stronghold. There, they discovered all the echoes, clones, sisters of Alias that the demonic false halfling created for himself. The creature revealed its true form - that of a beholder-like creature. Alias destroyed Phalse and reunited with her apparent creator, her father - Finder. There they were joined by Elminster. Finder gave thankyou gifts to the rescuers, and feeling connected to his daughter, requested one thing from Alias, a story of her life. Then and there, unknown even to her at the time, Olive became a Harper when Finder gave her his harper pin in the presence of Elminster Aumar.",

Olive \"borrowed\" a horse from a traveling noble, but the horse pulled up lame, and the bard needed a ride. Olive claimed she was on a mission for the Harpers to secure the aid of the adventurers. In reality, the Harpers knew not of her intentions, but Olive's objective was, indeed, aligned with the secret organization's goals.\n\nOlive was in pursuit of the artifact known as the Blade of Lathander, stolen by a halfling Benjil Turcot, who was later killed by the Zhentarim. The evil organization claimed the blade was lost at sea, but Olive knew it not to be true. The blade was in Fzoul Chembryl's possession, and the \"bard\" was aiming at stealing it back.\n\nAs the group reached Zhentil Keep, Olive disappeared into the crowd, hoping the adventurers of the Azure Bonds were going to create trouble on their own, allowing her to pull the heist. Eventually, the adventurers found themselves imprisoned in the dungeons of the Temple of Bane after an unfortunate encounter. Olive used her thieving abilities to rescue them from the cell and accompanied them through the Temple and the Tower of Fzoul.\n\nAfter the adventurers survived the Keep and retrieved the Blade of Lathander, Olive, of course, made away with the artifact but was politely persuaded by Elminster to return them to the adventurers of the Azure Bonds unless Olive was to take on Tyranthraxus by herself.

The young human female thief became Olive's close friend and partners over the winter they spent together in Immersea. Olive knew Jade was one of Alias' clones, one of her echoes, but the halfling had no desire to share that information with the young woman, at least not yet.\n\nIn 1358 DR, Olive came face to face with Finder's prodigal son, one of the woeful mistakes he was atoning for in exile. Jade attempted to pickpocket Flattery Wyvernspur but was disintegrated, to Olive's horror. The halfling fled with Jade's possessions while being pursued by the murderer. Jade's bag of holding contained Giogi's magic belt pouch she lifted off the young Wyvernspur who resided in Immersea. While hiding from Flattery, Olive ransacked the bags' contents, searching for any way of saving her life. And she succeeded, but Giogi's belt pouch had an enchantment put on it that transformed anyone, but Giogi himself, opening the bag into a burro. Flattery discovered the scared donkey but did not realize it was one of the thieves he chased. Olive recognized the familiar facial features prevalent in all of the Wyvernspurs. Later, drunk Giogi discovered Olive in her burro form wandering on his family's land and assumed she was a new estate purchase. Giogi named his new favorite pet Birdie and took her to the Redstone Castle's carriage house stables.\n\nAs the young noble's pack animal, Olive was taken to the Wyvernspur family crypt when Giogiani was tasked by his stern aunt to find the family heirloom's thief, who was supposedly trapped inside. The heirloom was the Wyvern\u0092's Spur that was secretly taken from the crypt by Jade earlier. Inside the crypt, donkey Olive and Giogi ran into another one of Alias' echoes created by Phalse, a young wizard Cat who was sent by the villain Flattery to steal the heirloom. Giogi decided to give the young woman, the unwilling servant of the evil mage, his protection, to the donkey Olive's cynical eye-roll. After failing to find the Spur and capturing the thief, they returned to the castle, where donkey Olive overheard a plot by two of Giogi's cousins to get their greedy hands on the heirloom and its magic.\n\nThe enchantment expired, turning Olive from a donkey into a sassy halfling once more to her infinite joy. Olive used her Harper pin to get an audience with giogi at the Redstone Castle the following morning. She revealed to the young nobleman all she found out in the burro form, impressing him. The halfling bard deducted that, in fact, Jade was the thief and the Wyvern's Spur was in her possession, the fact that she did not disclose to anyone else. Olive hoped that Cat had the same anti-detection magic weaved into her being like Alias did and passed the Spur to her, disguised as a magical protection trinket. During the same visit to the Redstone Castle, Olive discovered that Jade's benefactor, who was behind the Spur's disappearance, was uncle Drone Wyvernspur. Drone knew of Flattery's plans and attempted to beat him to it to protect the heirloom. Uncle Drone also adopted Jade to grant her the Wyvernspur name allowing her access to the crypts. Funny enough, Jade was already a Wyvernspur, being one of the daughters of Finder Wyvernspur.\n\nConsequently, Flattery Wyvernspur kidnapped a newborn baby Amberlee, Giogi's new favorite family member. The villain held Amberlee hostage, demanding the Wyvern's Spur. Giogi, Cat, Olive, and Aunt Dorath Wyvernspur were the heroes responsible for the evil wizard's fall and the child's rescue. Olive used her stealth skills to pass the Spur between Dorath and Giogi after the child was delivered to safety. Although the wizard and Giogi's battle in the skies did not involve Olive, she nevertheless became a close ally and a friend of the family. She performed at baby Amberlee's Sel\u00fbnite blessing ceremony but declined the offer to stay at Giogi's old townhouse and moved on. Immersea held too many bittersweet memories for Olive to stick around. She truly missed Jade.",

Olive did not trust Harpers to treat the Nameless Bard fairly, so she aimed at helping him escape. Finder politely declined Olive's thoughtful aid on account of being able to escape on his own at any time, but he deserved their judgment. Even though he did not want to escape, Finer accepted a gift Olive brought with her, the Finder's Stone. The stone was lost a year prior in battle with Moander and was accidentally picked up by hapless Giogi Wyvernspur. Olive recognized the artifact in his possession and returned the Stone to its creator. Shortly after this, the Tower was drowned in the sounds of commotion, and a saurial wizard Grypht appeared in the cell, informing Finder of Moander's return. Of course, Olive did not understand the saurial language the conversation was held in, and it frustrated her to no end.\n\nAnother visitor arrived at the Finder's cell, a Harper agent Kyre, secretly enslaved and rotten from the inside by Moander's vines. Olive hid, and the corrupted Harper used magic to imprison Grypht. Kyre's next task was Finder's assassination. With Olive's aid, Finder had enough time to tap into Finder's Stone magic and teleported himself and the halfling to relative safety, but not before Moander's assassin snatched the Stone.\n\nThe teleport spell brought Olive and Finder to the Nameless Bard's old laboratory, the Finder\u0092's Keep, in the Spiderhaunt Woods. The duo was attempting to access Finder's old magic items and artifacts to aid them against the returned god of rot. Olive's thieving skills and tiny size were a great help in navigating through collapsed halls and rooms. Unfortunately, not all old traps were disarmed by the ravages of time and scavenging monsters. Finder triggered one of the poison needle traps as they were attacked by orcs led by another rotten slave of Moander's, a beholder. Olive managed to loot a potion that stabilized the Nameless Bard, but he was in no shape to continue on, and the halfling stashed him in a safe spot and continued to search for his old laboratory on her own. The door to Finder's lab was magically protected. Thankfully, Olive was a good singer and could easily replicate all the notes she needed to hit to enter. Inside the lab, Olive discovered that Finder's construct son Flattery ransacked it a long time ago and left a magical trap to kill his hated parent. Olive escaped the deathly magical rays by a lock of her hair, literally. Other than the trap, the laboratory was empty. Flattery took every magic item he could find in there. Olive, probably for the first time in her life, felt tired, empty, and hopeless. She collapsed under the weight of despair and uncontrollable tears.\n\nOlive snapped out of her despair when she heard her friend Finder in his weak state confronting the orcs and their beholder leader Xaran. The beholder was negotiating Finder's life in exchange for the knowledge. Finder's charisma earned him the life-saving antidote. Olive, with the ferocity of a wolverine, jumped out of her shelter to save her friend. She attacked Xaran, disorienting him momentarily, and managed to push Finder into the lab. She jumped inside, slamming the door behind and hoping the magic wards would give them some time to come up with a plan. The halfling did not accomplish that assault unscathed; she was wounded by one of the beholder's deadly eye beams. Finder uncovered his old horn of blasting from under the rubble inside the workshop. The duo fled the orc army and the beholder after using the horn to collapse the ceiling on the villains' heads. It did not kill the Moander's pawn, and the chase only slowed down until Olive and Finder found themselves at a dead-end, with only a section of a collapsed ceiling protecting them from the orcs.\n\nThe duo eventually heard Alias and her party's arrival, guided by the Finder's Stone. With Olive's distraction, the heroes defeated the beholder, reuniting Alias with her father, and Olive with her friends. Together they used the power of the Finder's Stone to confront Moander in the Lost Vale where the god enslaved a tribe of saurials, the tribe Dragonbait belonged to. Olive and her friends succeeded in rescuing the saurials and destroying the god, but at a steep price. Akabar Bel Akash sacrificed his life to stop Moander, and Finder used the shard of para-elemental ice inside the Finder's Stone to destroy the god, perishing in the process. Unknown to Olive at the time, Finder inherited Moander's divinity, becoming a demi-god himself. Eventually, Olive became one of his first followers.",

The wealthier, usually more senior members of the House sponsored the event: by providing the treasure to be hunted; paying healing fees to clergy of various faiths; and hiring wizards to facilitate the Hunt, enforce the rules, and, beginning with the second Hunt, provide visual observation of the participants while they wandered about Undermountain.\n\nAt the kick-off revel (where much alcohol was available), the ceremony began with the Black Bucket being escorted by a bevy of women wearing masks. The large Bucket appeared to have seen many years of hard use and was blackened by exposure to fire. It contained tokens that were drawn by the participants to randomly determine teams. After the drawing, there were typically at least eight teams with a minimum of six persons on each team. The empty Bucket was then filled with rubies and twelve tokens that granted the bearer freedom from city taxes, fees, and fines for one year. In a flare of pageantry and showy spells, the Black Bucket was teleported away to \"a secret corner of Undermountain\". Likewise, monsters were summoned and sent off to provide a challenge to the hunters.\n\nThe \"Hunting Ground\" for the event was the Dungeon Level of Undermountain with many of its exits to lower levels temporarily walled off. Prior to the event, various adventuring groups (mostly from outside the city) were hired to kill or remove the worst monsters from the Hunting Ground. Invariably, these same groups were approached by agents from noble families with an interest in the outcome of the Hunt to plant notes, disallowed weapons, and/or fake Black Buckets in the section they were clearing. In addition to the summoned monsters and those left behind by the cleansing crews (skeletons, spiders, etc.), there were other unpleasant hazards throughout the Hunting Ground, such as heaps of smelly refuse, dung slides, and \"perfume bombs\"\u2014breakable bags of inexpensive, strong-scented liquids that could be thrown at rivals or creatures.\n\nAfter teams were chosen, the participants donned silly costumes to represent their team. They were made of thin, cheap cloth in bright colors (pink, yellow, orange, etc.) and styled to give the wearers a distinctive characteristic, such as a huge bird beak, a wagging tail, or a dozen extra tiny arms. The costumes were enchanted to glow like a torch and were the only source of light allowed on the Hunt. Likewise, all armor, weapons, and magic items were prohibited, but the contestants did their best to sneak them in. The teams then formed a loud and boisterous parade through the streets of Waterdeep in their ridiculous, luminous splendor to places where they would either be teleported into the Hunting Ground or escorted to an entrance through a cellar, and the Hunt began.",

Since the teams were chosen at random, it was possible that rivals and enemies could be placed in close proximity to each other, or even on the same team. Fights commonly broke out between teams and between team members using whatever weapons were at hand or smuggled in. At best, a person might get their face rubbed in some foul substance or be doused with a perfume bomb, but it was not uncommon to be stripped of one's costume and left to wander alone in the dark. At worst, there were serious injuries, maimings, and murders.\n\nDuring the first annual Black Bucket Hunt, those left behind had to wait until the winning team appeared back at the revel to find out what happened, although some wizards may have spied on the proceedings with arcane eye. By the second Hunt, a modified version of arcane eye that allowed the image from the eye to be projected in the air for anyone to view was under development and was successfully cast twice. The violent and salacious images brought back were deemed greatly entertaining by the crowd and more such remote viewing was strongly demanded at future Hunts. Representatives of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors were tasked to watch for and prevent any other spells from being cast into the Hunting Ground.

The first Hunt was hosted by the Kothont family and the second was taken on by the Urmbrusks. Between Hunts, the Black Bucket was displayed in an alcove of the entry hall of Piergeiron's Palace. The guards and magical wards were increased after each of several thefts of the iconic trophy.\n\nDespite the silly pageantry and frivolous nature of the Black Bucket Hunt, the event gained a particular notoriety in Waterdeep that spread down the Sword Coast and northward as well. It was spoken of with pride to non-natives, and those that risked humiliation, injury, and death in a Hunt experienced an increase in social standing. The winners, even if they were commoners or outsiders, were welcomed into various cliques, guilds, and formal groups that otherwise would have been unreceptive.\n\nDuring the second Hunt, modified arcane eye spells revealed two encounters that fascinated the viewing crowd and ensured that more such spells would be cast at the next Hunt. The first was a fight between teams where Guster Ilitul was clearly shown strangling Delbert Thorp to death and then stuffing the body in some watery nook. The second was a passionate interlude between Daervin Husteem and Tlannada Gralhund that displayed more than just acrobatic flexibility. Arsten Thunderstaff II technically broke the rules by magically teleporting a large quantity of cherry fruit jelly to their location, dumping it on the randy lovers and their immediate surroundings.",
